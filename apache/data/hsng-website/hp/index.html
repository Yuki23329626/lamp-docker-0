                                                                    exam., students with low achievement were asked if they want to participate the project. Fifteen students were chosen to be in experimental group. Each of these students was given a HP
                                                                    table PC. They were asked to write their homework using the MMC tool on the table PC. TAs of the course analyzed their answers which were written step by step and figured out possible
                                                                    misconceptions of each student. The instructor lectured again on common misconceptions. One of the students said that “I was not very used to writing homework step by step using the Table
                                                                    PC. Later on, I realized that it is very helpful to diagnose my misconceptions. Now, I am very used to using Table PC and this project is really a big help to my learning in Linear Algebra.
                                                                    I hope this project could keep going such that more students could benefit many more students.” One of the TAs said that “Examining students’ homework written in step by step manner using
                                                                    MMC is a great help to understand what has been misunderstood by students. For example, when the instructor explained the relation of subspace and its complement space, all students thought
                                                                    they understood the concept, so no one asked a question in the class. However, when they wrote the homework, it becomes clear that some students do not understand the sum of dimensions
                                                                    of subspace and its complement space should be equal to the dimension of the original space.” Among the 15 students participated in the project, one of them dropped out due to personal
                                                                    reason. Therefore, we analyzed the learning effect based on the rest 14 students. There were three mid-term examinations and one final examination. Table 1 shows the comparison of learning
                                                                    achievement of the control group and experimental group. From Table 1, we can observe that the mean score of students in the experimental group (32.43) is significantly lower than that
                                                                    of control group (65.93)(t=-8.920, p

After the first mid-term, students in experimental group were treated using methodology aforementioned. After the second mid-term, although
                                                                        the mean score of the experimental group is still lower than the control group, but there is no significant difference between these two groups. That is, the mean score of students in

                                                                    performance, students who learned in the dual-screen environment showed great appreciation on the use of dual-screen presentation. All the students in the dual-screen condition liked
                                                                    this system. Firstly, this system allowed the presented materials more organized and clearer, which helped students understand the content more. One student (A11) explained that the PowerPoint
                                                                    slides (on the left side) gave him a clear idea and content structure. He could distinguish the points that the instructors wrote down and the major content messages. <br /> In addition,
                                                                    with the spilt of content slides and the calculation processes on another slide, students were able to make references between these two. For example, A20 said while she could not quite
                                                                    understand the calculation, she was able to go back and forth between the main ideas on the PowerPoint slide and the slide of calculation process. Thirdly, since the projection screens
                                                                    were put on a higher place compared to the traditional whiteboard, students could see messages more clearly. Especially, with the use of projector, the layouts of content messages were
                                                                    brighter and clearer compared to the whiteboards. Most students even recommended that the instructor should use the dual-screen presentation system in the future.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Instructor’s  perception about using the dual-screen presentation system</strong><br /> The instructor showed great interest after using the dual-screen presentation system. She indicated
                                                                    several advantages of using this system. Firstly presenting the teaching materials with PowerPoint slides is a more efficient and organized way for teaching statistics. When she used
                                                                    the PowerPoint slides, she could show the concepts step by step. With the advantage of tablet PC, she was able to write down supplemental information and calculation process on the screen.
                                                                    Before she used this system, every time when she wanted to write down something else with the use of PowerPoint slides, she always had to go to the whiteboard to write the points down.
                                                                    By doing so, students sometimes were confused since they had to see the messages back and forth between the PowerPoint presentation and the whiteboard. <br /> In addition, with another
                                                                    blank slide, the instructor said she was able to show the calculation process clearly and students could compare the process with the formula or other important messages. The instructor
                                                                    also found that students were drawn more attention on her teaching when she used this system. <br /> However, the interface might not easy to use, the instructor mentioned. She indicated
                                                                    that it took some time to get familiar with the interface. When she used the interface to switch the screens, the interface was not intuitive enough to deal with. She had to click several
                                                                    buttons before she got the slides that she wanted. During the instruction, the lag time of switching screens may get in the way of the instruction flow.</p>
