"Service Location Modifications for IPv6", John Veizades, Erik Guttman,   11/20/1997. (9748 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the
       discovery and selection of network services.  Using this protocol,
       computers using IP based networks no longer need so much static
       configuration of network services for network based applications.
       This is especially important as computers become more portable, and
       users less tolerant of or less able to fulfill the demands of 
    network
       administration.
     
       The Service Location Protocol is well defined for use over IPv4
       networks [SLP]:  This document defines its use over IPv6 networks.
       Since this protocol relies on UDP and TCP, the changes to support 
    its
       use over IPv6 are minor.

"Service Templates and service:  Schemes", C. Perkins, Erik Guttman,   James Kempf, 11/21/1997. (65120 bytes)</A>
<dd>         The ''service:'' URL scheme name is used to define URLs (called
       ''service: URLs'' in this document) that are primarily intended to 
    be
       used by the Service Location Protocol in order to distribute service
       access information.  These schemes provide an extensible framework
       for client-based network software to obtain configuration 
    information
       required to make use of network services.  When registering a
       service: URL, the URL SHOULD be accompanied by a set of well-defined
       attributes which define the service.  These attributes SHOULD
       convey configuration information to client software, or service
       characteristics meaningful to end users.
     
       This document describes a formal procedure for defining and
       standardizing new service types and attributes for use with the
       ''service:'' scheme.  The formal descriptions of service types and
       attributes are templates that are human and machine understandable.
       They SHOULD be used by administrative tools to parse service
       registration information and by client applications to provide
       localized translations of service attribute strings.

"An API for Service Location", D. Provan, Erik Guttman, 11/24/1997. (129107 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides a new way for clients to
       dynamically discovery network services.  With SLP, it is simple to
       offer highly available services that require no user configuration
       or communication with network administrators prior to use.  This
       document describes standardized API's for SLP in C and Java.  The
       API's are modular and are designed to allow implementions to
       offer just the feature set needed.  In addition, a standardized
       configuration file format and a format for proxy registrations is
       defined.  The configuration file format allows SLP agents to set
       network and other parameters in a portable way.  The proxy file
       format allows legacy services to be registered with SLP directory
       agents in cases where modifying the legacy service program code is
       difficult or impossible.

       Internet domain, based on deployment experience with the Netfind
       White Pages directory software.
     
       This approach makes it possible to supply clients with more

"Wide Area Network Service Location", Jonathan Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne,  07/25/1997. (39627 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document discusses the problem of service location in wide area 
    networks. This problem arises when a user wishes to locate some 
    service, such as a media bridge, internet telephony gateway, H.323 
    Gate-keeper, unicast to multicast bridge, etc, which has some desired 
    characteristics, but whose location (in terms of IP address, domain, or
    geographical location) is completely unknown, and may be anywhere on 
    the public Internet. We focus on the problem of locating Internet 
    Telephony Gateways (devices which connect an IP host to a POTS user).  
    This particular location problem is characteristic of the general 
    problem; furthermore, location of these devices is particularly 
    difficult. Generally, the service location mechanisms need to be 
    invoked for every call setup. This implies that the call setup delays 
    will include the time to locate the gateway, and these delays should 
    therefore be kept to a minimum. With large numbers of gateways, the 
    location mechanisms can potentially become a network, processing, and 
    storage intensive operation. A solution to the gateway location problem
    must therefore be efficient and scalable in use of bandwidth, CPU 
    power, and disk storage.

"Conversion of LDAP Schemas to and from SLP Templates", Pete St. Pierre,   11/26/1997. (35760 bytes)</A>
