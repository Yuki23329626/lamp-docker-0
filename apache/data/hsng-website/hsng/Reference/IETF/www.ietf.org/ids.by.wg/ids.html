"Introducing a Directory Service", Erik Huizer, T. Verschuren, P. Jurg,   E. Jeunink, M. Jacobs, 10/17/1995. (111419 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This report provides a 'manual' for establishing an electronic White 
    Pages Directory Service within an organisation and for connecting it to
    a wide-area Directory infrastructure. It is based on the experiences 
    from the SURFnet Directory Services pilot project. The wide-area 
    service is of importance to all users of e-mail services who want to 
    find e-mail addresses of other e-mail users (worldwide!) or any other 
    address information such as telephone and fax numbers.     Establishing
    a White Pages Directory Service within an organisation includes a 
    technical, legal and data management component. As the amount of work 
    involved in the technical component can be reduced by using standard 
    equipment and by good support from the provider of the wide-area 
    Directory infrastructure, the legal and data management issues require 
    more attention. Legal aspects include formal registration of the 
    service, informing all registered persons about the service and data 
    protection.

"The CCSO Nameserver (Ph) Architecture", P. Pomes, Roland Hedberg,   05/06/1997. (33071 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The PH Nameserver from the [Computing and Communications Services 
    Office (CCSO),] University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has for some
    time now been used by several organizations as their choice of publicly
    available database for information about people as well as other 
    things.  It is now widely felt that the Internet community would 
    benefit from having a more rigorous definition of the client-server 
    protocol, this document will hopefully achieve that goal.  The Ph 
    service as specified in this document is built around an information 
    model, a client command language and the server responses.

"Best Current Practice for the Internet White Pages Service", Harald   Alvestrand, P. Jurg, 04/30/1997. (33213 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Internet is used for information exchange and communication between
    its users. It can only be effective as such if users are able to find 
    each other's addresses. Therefore the Internet benefits from an 
    adequate White Pages Service, i.e., a directory service offering 
    (Internet) address information related to people and organizations.

"Simple Nomenclator Query Protocol (SNQP)", J. Ordille, J. Elliott,   11/04/1997. (57984 bytes)</A>
<dd>        The Simple Nomenclator Query Protocol (SNQP) allows a client to
       communicate with a descriptive name service or other 
    relational-style
       query service.  The protocol is useful to services that search many
       data repositories for query responses.  Clients can pose queries on
       relations, list descriptions of relations, and obtain advice on
       reducing the search time and cost of their queries.  Clients are
       informed of the age of information in caches, and may request more
       recent information.  SNQP provides support for graphical user
       interfaces.  It also supports different types of comparison
       operators, so services can use SNQP with a variety of back-end
       servers, e.g. relational database servers, CCSO servers, and servers
       providing relational views of X.500.
     
       SNQP is an ASCII protocol in the request-reply style of SMTP.  It 
    was
       specifically designed for use with the Nomenclator name and
       information service, and has been useful elsewhere.

"Internet Nomenclator Project", J. Ordille, 11/04/1997. (34512 bytes)</A>
<dd>         The goal of the Internet Nomenclator Project is to integrate the
        hundreds of publicly available CCSO servers from around the world.
        Each CCSO server has a database schema that is tailored to the 
    needs
        of the organization that owns it.  The project is integrating the
        different database schema into one query service.  The Internet
        Nomenclator Project will provide fast cross-server searches for
        locating people on the Internet.  It augments existing CCSO 
    services
        by supplying schema integration, more extensive indexing, and two
        kinds of caching -- all this in a system that scales as the number
        of CCSO servers grows.  One of the best things about the system is
        that administrators can incorporate their CCSO servers into
        Nomenclator without changing the servers. All Nomenclator needs is
        basic information about the server.
     
        This document provides an overview of the Nomenclator system,
        describes how to register a CCSO server in the Internet Nomenclator
        Project, and how to use the Nomenclator search engine to find 
    people         on the Internet.

"Naming Plan for Internet Directory-Enabled Applications", Steve Kille,   Rick Huber, Sri Sataluri, A. Grimstad, M. Wahl, 09/10/1997. (34036 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Application of the conventional X.500 approach to naming has
       heretofore, in the experience of the authors, proven to be an
       obstacle to the wide deployment of directory-enabled applications on
       the Internet.  We propose a new directory naming plan that leverages
       the strengths of the most popular and successful Internet naming
       schemes for naming objects in a hierarchical directory.  This plan
       can, we believe, facilitate the creation of an Internet White Pages
       Service (IWPS) and other directory-enabled applications by 
    overcoming
       the problems encountered by those using the conventional X.500
       approach to naming.
