<dd>     This memo describes a protocol utilizing security concepts necessary 
    for establishing Security Associations (SA) and cryptographic keys in 
    an Internet environment.  A Security Association protocol that 
    negotiates, establishes, modifies and deletes Security Associations and
    their attributes is required for an evolving Internet, where there will
    be numerous security mechanisms and several options for each security 
    mechanism.  The key management protocol must be robust in order to 
    handle public key generation for the Internet community at large and 
    private key requirements for those private networks with that 
    requirement.        The Internet Security Association and Key 
    Management Protocol (ISAKMP) defines the procedures for authenticating 
    a communicating peer, creation and management of Security Associations,
    key generation techniques, and threat mitigation (e.g.  denial of 
    service and replay attacks).  All of these are necessary to establish 
    and maintain secure communications (via IP Security Service or any 
    other security protocol) in an Internet environment.                   (This Internet-Draft is also available in

"IP Authentication Header", Stephen Kent, Ran Atkinson, 11/24/1997. (52574 bytes)</A>
<dd>        The IP Authentication Header (AH) is used to provide connectionless
       integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams (hereafter
       referred to as just ''authentication''), and to provide protection
       against replays.  This latter, optional service may be selected, by
       the receiver, when a Security Association is established. (Although
       the default calls for the sender to increment the Sequence Number
       used for anti-replay, the service is effective only if the receiver
       checks the Sequence Number.)  AH provides authentication for as much
       of the IP header as possible, as well as for upper level protocol
       data.  However, some IP header fields may change in transit and the
       value of these fields, when the packet arrives at the receiver, may
       not be predictable by the sender.  The values of such fields cannot
       be protected by AH.  Thus the protection provided to the IP header 
    by
       AH is somewhat piecemeal.
     
       AH may be applied alone, in combination with the IP Encapsulating
       Security Payload (ESP) [KA97b], or in a nested fashion through the
       use of tunnel mode (see ''Security Architecture for the Internet
       Protocol'' [KA97a], hereafter referred to as the Security 
    Architecture
       document).  Security services can be provided between a pair of
       communicating hosts, between a pair of communicating security
       gateways, or between a security gateway and a host.  ESP may be used
       to provide the same security services, and it also provides a
       confidentiality (encryption) service.  The primary difference 
    between
       the authentication provided by ESP and AH is the extent of the
       coverage.  Specifically, ESP does not protect any IP header fields
       unless those fields are encapsulated by ESP (tunnel mode).  For more
       details on how to use AH and ESP in various network environments, 
    see
       the Security Architecture document [KA97a].

<dd>        [MSST97] (ISAKMP) provides a framework for authentication and key

       forward secrecy for keys, identity protection, and authentication).
     
       [Kra96] (SKEME) describes a versatile key exchange technique which
       provides anonymity, repudiability, and quick key refreshment.

"Inline Keying within the ISAKMP Framework.", B. Sommerfeld, 03/26/1997. (19144 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The current proposal for IP-layer key management [ISAKMP, OAKLEY, 
    ISAOAK] has fairly high overhead.  Before a security association can be
    established, at least one pair of messages need to be exchanged between
    the communicating peers.  For efficiency, this suggests that ISAKMP 
    setup should be infrequent.  However, general principles of key 
    management suggest that individual keys should be used as little as 
    practical and changed as frequently as possible.  Steve Bellovin has 
    suggested that, ideally, different security associations should be used
    for each different transport-level connection[BADESP]. This document 
    discusses a way of structuring a protocol to permit this to happen with
    minimal overhead, both in round-trip delay at connection setup, and in 
    bandwidth once the connection is established.          The general 
    concept of inline or in-band keying here was inspired by SKIP[SKIP].  
    However, SKIP's approach is burdened by the addition of an extra 
    intermediate header of perhaps 20 to 28 bytes to every protected 
    packet, which doubles the bandwidth overhead of protected traffic 
    compared with ESP with fixed keying.  In order to minimise the 
    per-packet overhead, an inline keying header

"A revised encryption mode for ISAKMP/Oakley", H. Krawczyk, P. Cheng, R.   Canetti, 08/05/1997. (16444 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The ISAKMP/Oakley document [HC97] describes a proposed standard for
       using the Oakley Key Exchange Protocol in conjunction with ISAKMP to
       obtain authenticated and secret keying material for use with ISAKMP,
       and for other security associations such as AH and ESP for the IETF

       The public-key encryption method of carrying out Phase 1 of the key
       exchange in the ISAKMP/Oakley document provides significant security
       advantages over the other alternatives and should be the method of
       choice in many implementations. Unfortunately, as currently
       described in [HC97] the method requires two public key
       encryption and decryption operations from both the Initiator and
       the Responder. The present document describes a small modification
       to this method. The resulting scheme requires only one public key
       encryption and decryption operation from each party, while 
    maintaining
       (and even improving on) the strong security properties of the
       ISAKMP/Oakley public-key encryption mode.

"The ESP IDEA-CBC Algorithm Using Explicit IV", R. Adams, 07/22/1997. (13197 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This draft describes the use of the IDEA [Schneier] block cipher 
    algorithm in CBC mode with the IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload 
    (ESP) [Kent97].

"The ESP CAST5-128-CBC Transform", W. Simpson, Perry Metzger, 07/30/1997. (11276 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes the CAST5-128-CBC block cipher transform
       interface used with the IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).  It
       provides a full-sized 128-bit key, with a more secure derived ini-
       tialization variable, and a more efficient smaller datagram size.

"The ESP CBC-Mode Cipher Algorithms", R. Adams, R. Pereira, 10/02/1997. (25506 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This document describes how to use CBC-mode cipher algorithms with
       the IPSec ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) Protocol.  It not
       only clearly states how to use certain cipher algorithms, but also
       how to use all CBC-mode cipher algorithms.

"The Use of HMAC-RIPEMD-160-96 within ESP and AH", Niels Provos,   11/18/1997. (11776 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This draft describes the use of the HMAC algorithm [RFC-2104] in
       conjunction with the RIPEMD-160 algorithm [RIPEMD-160] as an
       authentication mechanism within the revised IPSEC Encapsulating
       Security Payload [ESP] and the revised IPSEC Authentication Header
       [AH]. HMAC with RIPEMD-160 provides data origin authentication and
       integrity protection.
     
       Further information on the other components necessary for ESP and AH
       implementations is provided by [Thayer97a].

"A GSS-API Authentication Mode for ISAKMP/Oakley", D. Piper, 11/26/1997. (16893 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This document describes an alternate authentication method for
       ISAKMP/Oakley which makes use of GSS-API to authenticate the Diffie-
       Hellman exchange.  The mechanism described here extends the
       authentication modes defined in [Harkins97] without introducing any
       modifications to the ISAKMP/Oakley key exchange protocol.  This
       constraint however, necessarily restricts the number of GSS-API
       exchanges and may limit the broader applicability of this method.
       Additional work is needed to provide a fully generalized solution.
       Such a solution will require ISAKMP/Oakley protocol modifications.
