"MIXER (Mime Internet X.400 Enhanced Relay):  Mapping between X.400 and   RFC 822/MIME", Steve Kille, 03/20/1997. (304441 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document relates primarily to the ITU-T 1988 and 1992 X.400 Series
    Recommendations / ISO IEC 10021 International Standard.  This ISO/ITU-T
    standard is referred to in this document as 'X.400', which is a 
    convenient shorthand.  Any reference to the 1984 Recommendations will 
    be explicit.  Any mappings relating to elements which are in the 1992 
    version and not in the 1988 version will be noted explicitly.  X.400 
    defines an Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS), making use of a store
    and forward Message Transfer System.  This document relates to the 
    IPMS, and not to wider application of X.400, such as EDI as defined in 
    X.435.

"Mapping between X.400 and RFC-822/MIME Message Bodies", Harald   Alvestrand, 04/30/1997. (94643 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document is a companion to [MIXER], which defines the principles 
    and translation of headers for interworking between MIME-based RFC-822 
    mail and X.400 mail.           This document defines how to map body 
    parts of X.400 messages into MIME entities and vice versa, including 
    the handling of multipart messages and forwarded messages.             
    A table of contents that should be quite useful for locating specific 
    sections is given in the back of the document.

<dd>     This document contains the body parts defined in RFC 1495 for carrying 
    image formats that were originally defined in MIME through an X.400 
    system.                                                                
    This document is an Experimental standard; if it turns out to be useful
    and widely deployed, it can be moved onto the standards track.         
    It also documents the OIDs assigned to these data formats as FTAM body 
    parts, which allow the MIME types to be converted to FTAM body parts; 
    this will probably be more useful than the new body parts defined here.

<dd>     This document contains the definitions, originally contained in RFC

    its X.400 representation.                                              
    This document is an Experimental standard; if it turns out to be useful

    NOTE: At the moment, this format does not seem appropriate for a 
    'general purpose image format for the Internet', if such a beast can 
    exist. It exists only to carry information that is already in G3 Fax 
    format, and may be usefully converted to other formats when used in 
    specific contexts.

"Carrying PostScript in X.400 and MIME", Harald Alvestrand, 02/20/1997. (6288 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes methods for carrying PostScript information in 
    the two standard mail systems MIME and X.400, and the conversion 
    between them. It uses the notational conventions of [BODYMAP], and the 
    conversion is further described in [MIXER].                            
    Two ways of carrying PostScript in X.400 are described.                
    One is using the FTAM Body Part, and one uses the Extended Body Part 
    originally described in RFC 1494.                                      
    The FTAM method is recommended.

"MaXIM-11 - Mapping between X.400 / Internet mail and Mail-11 mail", C.   Allocchio, 01/31/1997. (56969 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes a set of mappings which will enable inter 
    working between systems operating the ISO/IEC 10021 - CCITT (now ITU) 
    X.400 Recommendations on Message Handling Systems, and systems running 
    the Mail-11 (also known as DECnet mail or VMSmail) protocol.  The 
    specifications are valid both within DECnet Phase IV and DECnet/OSI 
    addressing and routing scheme.                                         
    The complete scenario of X.400 / MIME / Mail-11 is also considered, in 
    order to cover the possible complex cases arising in multiple gateway 
    translations.                                                          
    This document covers mainly the X.400 O/R address to/from Mail-11 
    address mapping and the RFC822 to/from Mail-11 ones; other mappings are
    based on MIXER specifications. Bodypart mappings are not specified in 
    this document: MIXER and MIME-MHS specifications can be applied to map 
    bodyparts between X.400, MIME and Mail-11, too. In fact MIME encoding 
    can be used without modifications within Mail-11 text bodyparts.   This
    document obsoletes RFC 1405, which was a combined effort of TERENA 
    Working Group on Messaging, and the IETF X.400 Ops Working Group.

"Using the Internet DNS to Distribute MIXER Conformant Global Address   Mapping (MCGAM)", C. Allocchio, 07/11/1997. (58022 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This memo is the complete technical specification to store in the 
    Internet Domain Name System (DNS) the mapping information (MCGAM) 
    needed by MIXER conformant e-mail gateways and other tools to map 
    RFC822 domain names into X.400 O/R names and vice versa.  Mapping 
    information can be managed in a distributed rather than a centralised 
    way. Organizations can publish their MIXER mapping or preferred gateway
    routing information using just local resources (their local DNS 
    server), avoiding the need for a strong coordination with any 
    centralised organization. MIXER conformant gateways and tools located 
    on Internet hosts can retrieve the mapping information querying the DNS
    instead of having fixed tables which need to be centrally updated and 
    distributed.    This memo obsoletes RFC1664. It includes the changes 
    introduced by MIXER specification with respect to RFC1327: the new 
    'gate1' (O/R addresses to domain) table is fully supported. Full 
    backward compatibility with RFC1664 specification is mantained, too.   
    RFC1664 was a joint effort of IETF X400 operation working group 
    (x400ops) and TERENA (formely named 'RARE') Mail and Messaging working 
    group (WG-MSG). This update was performed by the IETF MIXER working 
    group.

    1.  Mapping from a key to a value (or set of values), as might be done
        in a table lookup.
     
    2.  Mapping from a distinguished name to an associated value (or
        values), where the values are not defined by the owner of the
        entry.  This is achieved by use of a directory subtree.
