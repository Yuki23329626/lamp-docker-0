"Route Optimization in Mobile IP", C. Perkins, D. Johnson, 08/04/1997. (113346 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document defines extensions to the operation of the base Mobile IP
    protocol to allow for optimization of datagram routing from a 
    correspondent node to a mobile node.  Without Route Optimization, all 
    datagrams destined to a mobile node are routed through that mobile 
    node's home agent, which then tunnels each datagram to the mobile 
    node's current location.  The protocol extensions described here 
    provide a means for correspondent nodes that implement them to cache 
    the binding of a mobile node and to then tunnel their own datagrams for
    the mobile node directly to that location, bypassing the possibly 
    lengthy route for each datagram to and from the mobile node's home 
    agent.  Extensions are also provided to allow datagrams in flight when 
    a mobile node moves, and datagrams sent based on an out-of-date cached 
    binding, to be forwarded directly to the mobile node's new binding.

"Mobility Support in IPv6", C. Perkins, D. Johnson, 08/01/1997. (137350 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document specifies the operation of mobile computers using IPv6.
       Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, 
    regardless
       of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated
       away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of
       address, which provides information about the mobile node's current
       location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address 
    are
       transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables
       IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with
       its care-of address, and to then send packets destined for the 
    mobile
       node directly to it at this care-of address.

"Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP: Goals and Requirements", S. Glass, V.   Gupta, 01/24/1997. (24349 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document discusses problems arising out of the use of Mobile IP in
    a security conscious Internet and presents a list of solution 
    requirements deemed important. These problems may need to be resolved 
    in several stages. A priority order in which these problems should be 
    solved is also proposed.                                               
    All firewalls are assumed to implement standard mechanisms [RFCs 
    1825,1826,1827] for authentication and encryption proposed by the IPSec
    working group of the IETF.

"Reverse Tunneling for Mobile IP", G. Montenegro, 08/20/1997. (38044 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Mobile IP uses tunneling from the home agent to the mobile node's
       care-of address, but rarely in the reverse direction.  Usually, a
       mobile node sends its packets through a router on the foreign
       network, and assumes that routing is independent of source address.
       When this assumption is not true, it is convenient to establish a
       topologically correct reverse tunnel from the care-of address to the
       home agent.
     
       This document proposes backwards-compatible extensions to Mobile IP
       in order to support topologically correct reverse tunnels.  This
       document does not attempt to solve the problems posed by firewalls
       located between the home agent and the mobile node's care-of
       address.

"Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP: Guidelines for Firewalls and Mobile IP  entities", S. Glass, V. Gupta, 03/27/1997. (32668 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The use of network security mechanisms such as ingress filtering, 
    firewall systems and private address spaces can disrupt normal 
    operation of Mobile IP [GuGl97]. This document outlines behavioral 
    guidelines for Mobile Nodes, their Home Agents and intervening 
    Firewalls.  Compliance with these guidelines allows secure datagram 
    exchange between a mobile node and its home agent even across 
    firewalls, ingress filtering routers and distinct address spaces. To 
    its correspondent nodes, the mobile node appears to be connected to its
    home network even while roaming on the general Internet. It enjoys the 
    same connectivity (modulo performance penalities) and, if desired, 
    privacy outside its protected domain as on the inside.   The guidelines
    described here solve a restricted, but still useful, variant of the 
    general firewall traversal problem for Mobile IP. They make the 
    following assumptions: (a) All intervening firewalls belong to the 
    mobile node's protected home domain and their existence and relative 
    placement, with respect to a mobile node's current location, is known a
    priori. (b) Mobile nodes use co-located care-of addresses (rather than 
    Foreign Agents) when outside their protected home domain. (c) Firewalls
    implement standard

"IP Mobility Support version 2", C. Perkins, 11/14/1997. (198444 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent
       routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each
       mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of
       its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated
       away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a
       care-of address, which provides information about its current
       point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for
       registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent
       sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to
       the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each
       datagram is then delivered to the mobile node.
