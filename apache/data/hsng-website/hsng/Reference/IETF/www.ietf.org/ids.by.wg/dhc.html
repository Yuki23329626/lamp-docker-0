"Interaction between DHCP and DNS", Y Rekhter, 11/24/1997. (16367 bytes)</A>
<dd>        DHCP provides a powerful mechanism for IP host autoconfiguration.
       However, the autoconfiguration provided by DHCP does not include
       updating DNS, and specifically updating the name to address and

       This document specifies how DHCP clients and servers should use the
       Dynamic DNS Updates mechanism to update the DNS name to address and

       be consistent with the IP addresses that the clients acquire via
       DHCP.

"An option for FQDNs in DHCP options", Ralph Droms, Y Rekhter,   07/25/1997. (8118 bytes)</A>
<dd>     DHCP [DHCP] can be used to automate the process of configuring TCP/IP 
    host computers.  However, some of the DHCP options carry IP addresses 
    rather than Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN). Use of IP addresses 
    constrains the DHCP client to use the addresses that were in use at the
    time the client received its configuration information; these addresses
    may change over time, (e.g., a server may be assigned a new IP 
    address), so that the IP addresses used by the client may become 
    invalid.                        An alternative to passing IP addresses 
    is to pass FQDNs instead of (numeric) IP addresses.  Doing this allows 
    a client to defer binding between a particular network entity (e.g., a 
    server) and its IP address until run time.  As stated in 
    [Carpenter:96], 'Deferring the binding avoids the risk of changed 
    mapping between IP addresses and specific network entities (due to 
    changing addressing information).  Moreover, reliance on FQDNs (rather 
    than IP addresses) also localizes to the DNS the changes needed to deal
    with changing addressing information due to renumbering.'     This 
    document defines a new DHCP option that allows the use of FQDNs instead
    of IP addresses in DHCP options.

"DHCP Relay Agent Information Option", M. Patrick, 08/01/1997. (23092 bytes)</A>
<dd>        Newer high-speed public Internet access technologies call for a

       It is advantageous to use DHCP to assign user host IP addresses in

    arise
       with such 'public' DHCP use.  This draft calls for the definition of
       a 'DHCP Relay Agent Information' option that is appended to a DHCP
       packet forwarded from a client to a server by a relay agent.  The
       Server may or may not use the information in the the Relay Agent
       Information option; in either case, it echoes back the option
       verbatim in server-to-client replies.

       information known by the relay agent.  The initial sub-options are

       System.

"DHCP Failover Protocol", Ralph Droms, Arun Kapur, Greg Rabil, Mike   Dooley, 11/21/1997. (18019 bytes)</A>
<dd>        DHCP [RFC 2131] allows for multiple servers to be operating on a
       single network. Some sites are interested in running multiple 
    servers
       in such a way so as to provide redundancy in case of server failure.
       In order for this to work reliably, the servers must maintain a
       consistent database of the lease information.  This implies that
       servers will need to coordinate any and all lease activity so that
       this information is synchronized in case of failover.
     
       This document defines a protocol to provide this synchronization
       between two servers.  One server is designated the ''primary'' 
    server,
       the other is the ''secondary'' server.  Additionally, this document
       describes a protocol for the automatic transfer of control from the
       primary to the secondary in the case of failure (failover), as well
       as the re-establishment of control by the primary server.

"DHCP Continuation Option Code", Angelos Keromytis, William Arbaugh,   11/24/1997. (4865 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework
       for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.
       Currently options are limited to an information size of 256 bytes
       because of the one-octet size of the length field. This document
       defines a new option that permits the continuation of the previous
       option information.
