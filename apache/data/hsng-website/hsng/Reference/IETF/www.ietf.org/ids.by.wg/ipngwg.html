<dd>     This document describes how to compress multiple IP headers and TCP

<dd>     On February 27-28, 1997, the IPng Working Group held an interim
       meeting in Palo Alto, California to consider adopting Mike O'Dell's
       'GSE - An Alternate Addressing Architecture for IPv6' proposal 
    [GSE].
       In GSE, 16-byte IPv6 addresses are split into three portions: a
       globally unique End System Designator (ESD), a Site Topology    
    Partition (STP) and a Routing Goop (RG) portion. The STP corresponds
       (roughly) to a site's subnet portion of an IPv4 address, whereas the
       RG identifies the attachment point to the public Internet. Routers
       use the RG+STP portions of addresses (called 'Routing Stuff' in this
       document) to route packets to the link to which the destination is
       directly attached; the ESD is used to deliver the packet across the
       last hop link. An important idea in GSE is that nodes within a site
       do not know the RG portion of their addresses. A border router at 
    the
       site's Internet connect point would dynamically replace the RG part
       of source addresses of all outgoing IP datagrams and the RG part of
       destination addresses on incoming traffic.
    
       This document provides a detailed analysis of the GSE plan. Much of
       the analysis presented here is an expansion of official meeting
       minutes, though it also includes issues uncovered by the authors in
       the process of fully fleshing out the analysis. In summary, the
       working group eventually decided that the full addresses of nodes
       within a site should not be hidden from those nodes, so as a result
       it is not necessary for routers to rewrite the Routing Goop portion
       of addresses.  However, other parts of the GSE plan were adopted
       (e.g., having 64-bit interface identifiers with an option for
       specifying them as globally unique and easing the renumbering of the
       high-order portion of addresses within DNS).
    
       In addition to analyzing the GSE proposal in particular, the 
    document
       also studies the general issue of separating network

       Version 6 protocol [IPV6].  The document includes the IPv6 
    addressing

"IPv6 Testing Address Allocation", J. Postel, Bob Fink, Bob Hinden,   07/16/1997. (7130 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes an allocation plan for IPv6 addresses to be 
    used in testing IPv6 prototype software.  These addresses are temporary
    and will be reclaimed in the future.  Any IPv6 system using these 
    addresses will have to renumber at some time in the future.  These 
    addresses will not to be routable in the Internet other than for IPv6 
    testing.            The address format for the IPv6 test address is 
    consistent with the 'Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Allocation' 
    [AGGR] and 'TLA and NLA Assignment Rules' [TLAASN].                    
    This document is intended to replace RFC1897 'IPv6 Testing Address 
    Allocation', January 1996.  RFC1897 will become historic.              
    The addresses described in this document are consistent with the IPv6 
    Addressing Architecture [ARCH].  They may be assigned to nodes 
    manually, with IPv6 Auto Address Allocation [AUTO], or with DHCP for 
    IPv6 [DHCPv6].  The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',

"IPv6 Name Lookups Through ICMP", M. Crawford, 07/25/1997. (13332 bytes)</A>
<dd>     IPv4 addresses are translated to fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) 
    using the DNS.  Experience shows that the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones used for 
    this translation tend to be poorly maintained in many cases.  In a 
    larger internet with more frequent site renumbering, the maintenance of
    such zones will be even more difficult.                                
    This document describes a protocol for simply asking an IPv6 node to 
    supply its FQDN when needed.  The DNS style of authority delegation is 
    thus eliminated for IPv6 address-to-name translations and the routing 
    infrastructure plays that role.

<dd>     This document specifies the steps a host takes in deciding how to

"Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6",, 11/19/1997. (71823 bytes)</A>
<dd>        The de facto standard application program interface (API) for TCP/IP
       applications is the ''sockets'' interface.  Although this API was
       developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented 
    on
       a wide variety of non-Unix systems.  TCP/IP applications written
       using the sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of
       portability and we would like the same portability with IPv6
       applications.  But changes are required to the sockets API to 
    support
       IPv6 and this memo describes these changes.  These include a new
       socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address
       conversion functions, and some new socket options.  These extensions
       are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required 
    by
       TCP and UDP applications, including multicasting, while introducing 
    a
       minimum of change into the system and providing complete
       compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.  Additional extensions
       for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access to the IPv6
       extension headers) are defined in another document [6].
