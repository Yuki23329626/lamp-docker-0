"PEP - an Extension Mechanism for HTTP", D. Connolly, H. Nielsen, R.   Khare, 07/15/1997. (72795 bytes)</A>
<dd>     HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities 
    than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from 
    distributed authoring, collaboration, and printing, to various remote 
    procedure call mechanisms. The Protocol Extension Protocol (PEP) is an 
    extension mechanism designed to address the tension between private 
    agreement and public specification and to accommodate extension of 
    applications such as HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The PEP 
    mechanism is designed to associate each extension with a URI[2], and 
    use a few new RFC 822[1] derived header fields to carry the extension 
    identifier and related information between the parties involved in an 
    extended transaction.                                                  (This Internet-Draft is also available in

<dd>     Recent Internet applications, such as the World Wide Web, tie together

    mechanisms, which tailor the data which is exchanged, or the exchange

    Extensible negotiation mechanisms need a vocabulary to identify various

    registration process is needed to ensure that that this vocabulary, 
    which can be shared between negotiation mechanisms, is developed in an 
    orderly, well-specified, and public manner.

"HTTP Trust Mechanism for State Management", D. Jaye, 10/27/1997. (22482 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document specifies an addition to the state management protocol
    specified in draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-03[Kristol].  The intent is
    to provide a mechanism that allows user agents to determine the privacy
    practices of a server and to accept or reject cookies based on those
    practices.  Allowing the user to establish preferences for how to 
    handle
    cookies based on the server's practices provides a practical mechanism 
    to provide users control over the privacy implications of cookies.
     
    To provide verification of server privacy practices, we assume the
    existence of one or more independent Trust Authorities.  The authority
    establishes PICS ratings representing server privacy practices. It then
    issues trust-labels, in the form of digitally signed PICS labels, to
    organizations for specific domains and paths based on the server 
    privacy
    practices.  The Trust Authority must be able to audit domains to
    verify their adherence to a given level.  Passing these trust-labels
    along with cookies allows the user agent to support cookie handling 
    preferences based on trusted privacy practices.
     
    This document describes how PICS-headers are used in conjunction with
    Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2 headers in [Kristol] to provide trust-labels
    to communicate the privacy practices of servers regarding cookies.

"Scenarios for the Delivery of Negotiated Content", E. Hardie,   11/18/1997. (14412 bytes)</A>
<dd>     A number of Internet application protocols have a need to provide

    MIME media types [1] provide a standard method for handling one
    major axis of variation, resources also vary in ways which cannot be
    expressed using currently available MIME headers.  This paper asserts
    that a cross-protocol negotiation framework is needed, both to
    leverage work already done for specific protocols and to allow for
    content negotiation when resources will pass through several
    protocols on their way from provider to recipient.  To justify the
    need, this paper puts forward several content negotiation scenarios
    and discusses how they affect the requirements for such a framework.

<dd>     The protocol referred to as 'HTTP/1.0' includes the specification for
       a Basic Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered
       to be a secure method of user authentication, as the user name and

       for a different authentication scheme is needed to address this
       severe limitation.  This document provides specification for such a
       scheme, referred to as 'Digest Access Authentication'.  Like Basic,
       Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a
       communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this
       verification can be done without sending the password in the clear,
       which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other authentication
       protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not in 
    the
       core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its

           system such as SSL [5]), as the user name and password are 
    passed over
           the network as clear text.
     
           This document also provides the specification for HTTP's 
    authentication
           framework, the original Basic authentication scheme and a scheme
    based
           on cryptographic hashes, referred to as ''Digest Access 
    Authentication''.
           It is therefore intended to also serve as a replacement for RFC 
    2069.[6]
     
           Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both 
    parties to a
           communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, 
    this
           verification can be done without sending the password in the 
    clear,
           which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other 
    authentication
           protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not 
    in the
           core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding 
    its use.
