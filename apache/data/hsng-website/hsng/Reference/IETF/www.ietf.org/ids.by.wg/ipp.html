"Requirements for an Internet Printing Protocol", F. Wright, 10/16/1997. (104985 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document is one of a set of documents which together
              describe all aspects of a new Internet Printing Protocol 
    (IPP).
              IPP is an application level protocol that can be used for
              distributed printing on the Internet. The protocol is heavily
              influenced by the printing model introduced in the Document
              Printing Application (ISO/IEC 10175 DPA) standard. Although 
    DPA
              identifies the both end user and administrative features, IPP
    is
              initially focused only on the end user functionality.

<dd>              This document is one of a set of documents, which together

    an

    (IPP/1.0)
             focuses only on end user functionality.

               Requirements for an Internet Printing Protocol [IPP-REQ]

             The requirements document, ''Requirements for an Internet 
    Printing
             Protocol'', takes a broad look at distributed printing 
    functionality,
             and it enumerates real-life scenarios that help to clarify the
             features that need to be included in a printing protocol for 
    the
             Internet.  It identifies requirements for three types of 
    users: end
             users, operators, and administrators.  The requirements 
    document calls
             out a subset of end user requirements that MUST be satisfied 
    in
             IPP/1.0.  Operator and administrator requirements are out of 
    scope for
             version 1.0. This document, ''Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: 
    Model and
             Semantics'', describes a simplified model with abstract 
    objects, their
             attributes, and their operations.  The model introduces a 
    Printer and
             a Job.  The Job supports multiple documents per Job.  The

"Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols", J. Martin, T. Hasting, R.   Herriot, N. Jacobs, 11/24/1997. (51720 bytes)</A>
<dd>          This Internet-Draft specifies the mapping between (1) the commands
         and operands of the ''Line Printer Daemon (LPD) Protocol'' 
    specified
         in RFC 1179 and (2) the operations and parameters of the Internet
         Printing Protocol (IPP).  One of the purposes of this document is
         to compare the functionality of the two protocols.  Another 
    purpose
         is to facilitate implementation of gateways between LPD and IPP.
     
         This document is an informational document that is not on the
         standards track.  It is intended to help implementors of gateways
         between IPP and LPD.  It also provides an example,  which gives
         additional insight into IPP.
     
         WARNING:  RFC 1179 was not on standards track.  While RFC 1179 was
         intended to record existing practice, it fell short in some areas.
         However, this specification maps between (1) the actual current
         practice of RFC 1179 and (2) IPP.  This document does not attempt
         to map the numerous divergent extensions to the LPD protocol that
         have been made by many implementers.

    first version of IPP.  Operator and administrator requirements are out
    of scope for v1.0. The model and semantics document describes a
    simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes, and their
    operations. The model introduces a Printer object and a Job object.  
    The
    Job object supports multiple documents per job. The protocol
    specification is formal document which incorporates the ideas in all 
    the
    other documents into a concrete mapping using clearly defined data
    representations and transport protocol mappings that real implementers
    can use to develop interoperable client and printer (server) side
    components.

    (IPP).
              IPP is an application level protocol that can be used for
              distributed printing on the Internet. There are multiple 
    parts
              to IPP, but the primary architectural components are the 
    Model,
              the Protocol and an interface to Directory Services. This
              document provides a high level overview of the architecture
              and provides the rationale for the decisions made in
              structuring the architecture.
