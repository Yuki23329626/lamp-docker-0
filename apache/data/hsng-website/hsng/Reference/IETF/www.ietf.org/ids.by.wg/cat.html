"Independent Data Unit Protection Generic Security Service Application   Program Interface  (IDUP-GSS-API)", C. Adams, 10/14/1997. (143599 bytes)</A>
<dd>        The IDUP-GSS-API extends the GSS-API [RFC-2078] for applications
       requiring protection of a generic data unit (such as a file or
       message) in a way which is independent of the protection of any 
    other
       data unit and independent of any concurrent contact with designated
       'receivers' of the data unit.  Thus, it is suitable for applications
       such as secure electronic mail where data needs to be protected
       without any on-line connection with the intended recipient(s) of 
    that
       data.  The protection offered by IDUP includes services such as data
       origin authentication with data integrity, data confidentiality with
       data integrity, and support for non-repudiation services.  
    Subsequent
       to being protected, the data unit can be transferred to the
       recipient(s) - or to an archive - perhaps to be processed
       ('unprotected') only days or years later.
     
       Throughout the remainder of this document, the 'unit' of data
       described in the above paragraph will be referred to as an IDU
       (Independent Data Unit).  The IDU can be of any size (the 
    application
       may, if it wishes, split the IDU into pieces and have the protection
       computed a piece at a time, but the resulting protection token
       applies to the entire IDU).  However, the primary characteristic of
       an IDU is that it represents a stand-alone unit of data whose
       protection is entirely independent of any other unit of data.  If an
       application protects several IDUs and sends them all to a single    
    receiver, the IDUs may be unprotected by that receiver in any order
       over any time span; no logical connection of any kind is implied by
       the protection process itself.
     
       As with RFC-2078, this IDUP-GSS-API definition provides security
       services to callers in a generic fashion, supportable with a range 
    of
       underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing source-
       level portability of applications to different environments. This
       specification

"Generic Security Service API Version 2 : C-bindings", John Wray,   11/24/1997. (213241 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This draft document specifies C language bindings for Version 2 of 
    the
       Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI), 
    which
       is described at a language-independent conceptual level in other 
    drafts
       [GSSAPI]. It revises RFC-1509, making specific incremental changes 
    in
       response to implementation experience and liaison requests.  It is
       intended, therefore, that this draft or a successor version thereof 
    will
       become the basis for subsequent progression of the GSS-API 
    specification
       on the standards track.
     
       The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface 
    provides
       security services to its callers, and is intended for implementation
       atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  Typically,
       GSSAPI callers will be application protocols into which security
       enhancements are integrated through invocation of services provided 
    by
       the GSSAPI. The GSSAPI allows a caller application to authenticate a
       principal identity associated with a peer application, to delegate
       rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as 
    confidentiality
       and integrity on a per-message basis.

"The Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism", D. Pinkas, E.   Baize, 11/18/1997. (29510 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This draft document specifies a Security Negotiation Mechanism for the
    Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) which
    is described in [1].
     
    The GSS-API provides a generic interface which can be layered atop
    different security mechanisms such that if communicating peers acquire
    GSS-API credentials for the same security mechanism, then a security
    7context may be established between them (subject to policy). However,
    GSS-API doesn't prescribe the method by which GSS-API peers can
    establish whether they have a common security mechanism.
     
    The Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism defined here
    is a pseudo-security mechanism, represented by the object identifier
    iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanism.snego (1.3.6.1.5.5.2) which
    enables GSS-API peers to determine in-band whether their credentials
    share common GSS-API security mechanism(s), and if so, to invoke
    normal security context establishment for a selected common security
    mechanism. This is most useful for applications that are based on
    GSS-API implementations which support multiple security mechanisms.
    
    This allows to negotiate different security mechanisms, different
    options within a given security mechanism (such as different
    cryptographic algorithms due to policy or legislative constraints)
    or different options from several security mechanisms.
     
    Once the common security mechanism is identified, the mechanism may
    then negotiate mechanism-specific options during its context
    establishment. This will be inside the mechanism tokens, and
    invisible to the SPNEGO protocol.
     
    The simple and protected GSS-API mechanism negotiation is based on the
    following negotiation model : the initiator proposes one security
    mechanism or an ordered list of security mechanisms, the target either
    accepts the proposed security mechanism, or chooses one from an
    offered set, or rejects the proposed value(s). The target then informs
    the initiator of its choice.
     
    In

    application, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security 
    services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis. 
    The primitives of the GSS-API do not currently allow support of 
    security attributes other than a single identity and do not allow fine 
    control of delegation.
