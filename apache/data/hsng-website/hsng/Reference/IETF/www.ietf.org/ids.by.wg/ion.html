"NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)", D Katz, David Piscitello, B.   Cole, J. Luciani, 10/30/1997. (122237 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes the NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP).
       NHRP can be used by a source station (host or router) connected to a
       Non-Broadcast, Multi-Access (NBMA) subnetwork to determine the
       internetworking layer address and NBMA subnetwork addresses of the
       ''NBMA next hop'' towards a destination station.  If the destination
    is
       connected to the NBMA subnetwork, then the NBMA next hop is the
       destination station itself.  Otherwise, the NBMA next hop is the
       egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that is ''nearest'' to the
       destination station.  NHRP is intended for use in a multiprotocol 
    internetworking layer environment over NBMA subnetworks.
     
       Note that while this protocol was developed for use with NBMA
       subnetworks, it is possible, if not likely, that it will be applied
       to BMA subnetworks as well.  However, this usage of NHRP is for
       further study.  
    
       This document is intended to be a functional superset of the NBMA
       Address Resolution Protocol (NARP) documented in [1].
     
       Operation of NHRP as a means of establishing a transit path across 
    an
       NBMA subnetwork between two routers will be addressed in a separate
       document (see [13]).

"NHRP Protocol Applicability Statement", D. Cansever, 07/25/1997. (19032 bytes)</A>
<dd>     As required by the Routing Protocol Criteria [RFC 1264], this draft

"Classical IP and ARP over ATM", Mark Laubach, Joel Halpern, 10/07/1997. (64637 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This memo defines an initial application of classical IP and ARP in
       an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network environment configured 
    as
       a Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) as described in Section 5.  This memo
       does not preclude the subsequent development of ATM technology into
       areas other than a LIS; specifically, as single ATM networks grow to
       replace many Ethernet local LAN segments and as these networks 
    become
       globally connected, the application of IP and ARP will be treated
       differently.  This memo considers only the application of ATM as a
       direct replacement for the

"Definitions of Managed Objects for Classical IP and ARP Over ATM Using   SMIv2", M. Greene, T Kuo, J. Luciani, K. White, 07/14/1997. (82559 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The purpose of this memo is to define the Management Information Base 
    (MIB) for supporting Classical IP and ARP over ATM as specified in 
    Classical IP and ARP over ATM, refer to reference [3]. Support of an 
    ATM interface by an IP layer will require implementation of objects 
    from several Management Information Bases (MIBs) as well as their 
    enhancement in order to enable usage of ATM transports. It is the 
    intent of this MIB to fully adhere to all prerequisite MIBs unless 
    explicitly stated. Deviations will be documented in corresponding 
    conformance statements. The specification of this MIB will utilize the 
    Structure of Management Information (SMI) for Version 2 of the Simple 
    Network Management Protocol Version (refer to RFC1902, reference [1]).

"Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP)", Joel Halpern, G.   Armitage, J. Luciani, 10/30/1997. (94832 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol
       (SCSP) and is written in terms of SCSP's use within Non Broadcast
       Multiple Access (NBMA) networks; although, a somewhat straight
       forward usage is applicable to BMA networks.  SCSP attempts to solve
       the generalized cache synchronization/cache-replication problem for
       distributed protocol entities.  However, in this document, SCSP is
       couched in terms of the client/server paradigm in which distributed

"ATM Signalling Support for IP over ATM - UNI Signalling 4.0 Update", M.   Perez, 10/16/1997. ( bytes)</A>
<dd>     This memo describes how to efficiently use the ATM call control
       signalling procedures defined in UNI Signalling 4.0 [SIG40] to
       support IP over ATM environments as described in RFC XXX [LAUB97] 
    and
       in [LUC97]. Among the new features found in UNI Signalling 4.0 are
       Available Bit Rate signalling and traffic parameter negotiation.
       This draft highlights the features of UNI Signalling 4.0 that 
    provide
       IP entities capabilities for requesting ATM service in sites with 
    SVC
       support, whether it is private ATM or publicly provisioned ATM, in
       which case the SVC support is probably configured inside PVPs.
     
       This document is only relevant to IP when used as the well known
       ''best effort'' connectionless service. In particular, this means 
    that
       this document does not pertain to IP in the presence of implemented
       IP Integrated Services.  The topic of IP with Integrated Services
       over ATM will be handled by a different specification or set of
       specifications being worked on in the ISSLL WG.
     
       This specification is follow-on to RFC 1755, ''ATM Signaling Support
    for IP over ATM'', which is based on UNI 3.1 signalling [UNI95].
       Readers are assumed to be familiar with RFC 1755.

"IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) networks", G. Armitage,   M. Jork, P. Schulter, G. Harter, 10/13/1997. (98261 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes a general architecture for IPv6 over NBMA
       networks. It forms the basis for subsidiary companion documents that
       describe details for various specific NBMA technologies (such as ATM
       or Frame Relay). The IPv6 over NBMA architecture allows conventional
       host-side operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol, while
       also supporting the establishment of 'shortcut' NBMA forwarding 
    paths
       when dynamically signaled NBMA links are available. Operations over
       administratively configured Point to Point NBMA links are also
       described.
     
       Dynamic NBMA shortcuts are achieved through the use of IPv6 Neighbor
       Discovery protocol operation within Logical Links, and inter-router
       NHRP for the discovery of off-Link NBMA destinations. Both  
    flow-triggered and explicitly source-triggered shortcuts are supported.

<dd>     The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [NHRP] specifies a
