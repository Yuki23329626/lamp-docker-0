"Providing integrated services over low-bitrate links", C. Bormann,   07/24/1997. (32766 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes an architecture for providing integrated 
    services over low-bitrate links, such as modem lines, ISDN B-channels, 
    and sub-T1 links.  It covers only the lower parts of the Internet 
    Multimedia Conferencing Architecture [1]; additional components 
    required for application services such as Internet Telephony (e.g., a 
    session initiation protocol) are outside the scope of this document.  
    The main components of the architecture are: a real-time encapsulation 
    format for asynchronous and synchronous low-bitrate links, a header 
    compression architecture optimized for real-time flows, elements of 
    negotiation protocols used between routers (or between hosts and 
    routers), and announcement protocols used by applications to allow this
    negotiation to take place.     This document is a product of the IETF 
    ISSLL working group. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to 
    the working group's mailing list at issll@mercury.lcs.mit.edu and/or 
    the author.

"Interoperation of Controlled-Load and Guaranteed-Service with ATM", M.   Borden, M. Garrett, 08/04/1997. (104336 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Service mappings are an important aspect of effective interoperation 
    between Internet Integrated Services and ATM networks.  This document 
    provides guidelines for ATM virtual connection features and parameters 
    to be used in support of the IP integrated services protocols.  The 
    specifications include IP Guaranteed Service, Controlled-Load Service 
    and ATM Forum UNI specification, versions 3.0, 3.1 and 4.0.            
    These service mappings are intended to facilitate effective end-to-end 
    Quality of Service for IP networks containing ATM subnetworks.  We 
    discuss the various features of the IP and ATM protocols, and identify 
    solutions and difficult issues of compatibility and interoperation.

"A Framework for Providing Integrated Services Over Shared and Switched   LAN Technologies", Vijay Srinivasan, W. Pace, A. Ghanwani, 05/09/1997. (47425 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Traditionally, LAN technologies such as ethernet and token ring have 
    been required to handle best effort services only.  No standard 
    mechanism exists for providing service guarantees on these media as 
    will be required by emerging and future multimedia applications.  The 
    anticipated demand for such applications on the Internet has led to the
    development of RSVP, a signaling mechanism for performing resource 
    reservation in the Internet.  Concurrently, the Integrated Services 
    working group within the IETF has been working on the definition of 
    service classes called Integrated Services which are expected to make 
    use of RSVP. Applications will use these service classes in order to 
    obtain the desired quality of service from the network.  LAN 
    technologies such as token ring and ethernet typically constitute the 
    last hop in Internet connections.  It is therefore necessary to enhance
    these technologies so that they are able to support the Integrated 
    Services.  This memo describes a framework for providing the 
    functionality to support Integrated Services on shared and switched LAN
    technologies.

"Integrated Services over IEEE 802.1D/802.1p Networks", M. Seaman, A.   Smith, Eric Crawley, 06/23/1997. (77250 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes the support of IETF Integrated Services over 
    LANs built from IEEE 802 network segments which may be interconnected 
    by draft standard IEEE P802.1p switches.                               
    It describes the practical capabilities and limitations of this 
    technology for supporting Controlled Load [8] and Guaranteed Service 
    [9] using the inherent capabilities of the relevant 802 technologies 
    [5],[6] etc. and the proposed 802.1p queuing features in switches. IEEE
    P802.1p [2] is a superset of the existing IEEE 802.1D bridging 
    specification.  This document provides a functional model for the layer
    3 to layer 2 and user-to-network dialogue which supports admission 
    control and defines requirements for interoperability between switches.
    The special case of such networks where the sender and receiver are 
    located on the same segment is also discussed.       This scheme 
    expands on the ISSLL over 802 LANs framework described in [7]. It makes
    reference to an admission control signaling protocol developed by the 
    ISSLL WG which is known as the 'Subnet Bandwidth Manager'. This is an 
    extension  to the IETF's RSVP protocol [4] and is described in a
