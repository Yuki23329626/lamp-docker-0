"ACAP -- Application Configuration Access Protocol", C Newman, J Myers,   11/06/1997. (154662 bytes)</A>
<dd>        The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed to
       support remote storage and access of program option, configuration
       and preference information.  The data store model is designed to
       allow a client relatively simple access to interesting data, to 
    allow
       new information to be easily added without server re-configuration,
       and to promote the use of both standardized data and custom or
       proprietary data.  Key features include ''inheritance'' which can be
       used to manage default values for configuration settings and access
       control lists which allow interesting personal information to be
       shared and group information to be restricted.

"ACAP TYPE Extension", R. Earhart, 04/23/1997. (8891 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] defines rough 
    typing information in the form of an attribute naming convention.  This
    extension to ACAP allows a MIME content-type/subtype with parameters to
    be associated with a given piece of data, providing knowledgeable 
    clients with useful information in a way which maintains compatability 
    with innocent clients and servers.

"ACAP Datatyping and Datatyping Discovery", J. De Winter, 04/25/1997. (15224 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed to 
    support remote storage and access of program option, configuration and 
    preference information.  In certain circumstances, it is desirable or 
    necessary to deal with information that has a limit imposed on it. 
    While the general ACAP specification does provide for a (SYNTAX) alert 
    to inform the submittor that the stored information was not in a valid 
    syntax for that field, there is no generic method to discover that 
    syntax.            There is strong feeling in the ACAP working group 
    that variable length strings should be used for data where possible, 
    but there is also the knowledge that ACAP will be used to configure and
    access existing systems where the use of such variable length strings 
    may be difficult or impossible.

"Multi-Lingual String Format (MLSF)", C Newman, 06/09/1997. (23970 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The IAB charset workshop [IAB-CHARSET] concluded that for human 
    readable text there should always be a way to specify the natural 
    language.  Many protocols are designed with an attribute-value model 
    (including RFC 822, HTTP, LDAP, SNMP, DHCP, and ACAP) which stores many
    small human readable text strings.  The primary function of an 
    attribute-value model is to simplify both extensibility and 
    searchability.  A solution is needed to provide language tags in these 
    small human readable text strings, which does not interfere with these 
    primary functions.                           This specification defines
    MLSF (Multi-Lingual String Format) which applies another layer of 
    encoding on top of UTF-8 [UTF-8] to permit the addition of language 
    tags anywhere within a text string.  In addition, it defines an 
    alternate form which can be used to include alternative representations
    of the same text in different character sets.  MLSF has the property 
    that UTF-8 is a proper subset of MLSF. This preserves the searchability
    requirement of the attribute-value model. Appendix F of this document 
    includes a brief discussion of the background behind MLSF and why some 
    other potential solutions were rejected for this purpose.

"Anonymous SASL Mechanism", C Newman, 08/26/1997. (9084 bytes)</A>
<dd>          It is common practice on the Internet to permit anonymous access 
    to
         various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain
         text password mechanism using 'anonymous' as the user name and
         optional trace information, such as an email address, as the
         password.  As plaintext login commands are not permitted in new
         IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed
         within the context of the SASL [SASL] framework.

"Two Alternative Proposals for Language Taging in ACAP", M. Duerst,   06/23/1997. (23739 bytes)</A>
<dd>     For various computing applications, it is helpful to know the language 
    of the text being processed. This can be the case even if otherwise 
    only pure character sequences (so-called plain text) are handled.  From
    several sides, the need for such a scheme for ACAP has been claimed. 
    One specific scheme, called MLSF, has also been proposed, see 
    draft-ietf-acap-mlsf-01.txt for details.  This document proposes two 
    alternatives to MLSF. One alternative is using text/enriched-like 
    markup.  The second alternative is using a special tag-introduction 
    character.  Advantages and disadvantages of the various proposals are 
    discussed. Some general comments about the topic of language tagging 
    are given in the introduction.

"ACAP Authorization Identifier Datasets", S. Hole, 07/24/1997. (15552 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Most distributed (client/server) applications require an authentication
    process between the client and the server before the server will grant 
    access to its managed resources.  Many applications provide varying 
    levels of access to server resources based on a combination of 
    authentication credentials and access control rules.   The collection 
    of information used to control access to resources is called 
    'authorization information'.

"ACAP Personal Addressbook Dataset Class", C Newman, 07/29/1997. (28840 bytes)</A>
<dd>          IMAP [IMAP4] allows nomadic users to access their mailstore from
         any client, but it does not support storage of personal
         addressbooks.  Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP]
         provides an ideal mechanism for storage of personal addressbooks.
         While ACAP permits the definition of vendor specific solutions to
         this problem, having a standard addressbook dataset class permits
         clients from different vendors to interoperably share the same
         personal addressbooks.  This specification defines a standard
         dataset class for personal addressbooks.
     
         Personal addressbooks differ from white pages services because all
         the attributes and entries are controlled by the user who owns the
         addressbook rather than a directory administrator.  The user or 
    the
         clients he uses may add new attributes at any time and some of
         these attributes are not suitable for a white pages service.

"ACAP personal options dataset class", S. Hole, 07/30/1997. (11219 bytes)</A>
<dd>          The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed 
    to
         support remote storage and access of application option,
         configuration and preference information.  The generalized form of
         this runtime configuration is called 'options'.  Options consist
         consist of any type of structured or unstructured data that an
         application requires to operate in a user specific manner.
