"A Tagged Index Object for use in the Common Indexing Protocol", Roland   Hedberg, R. Moats, M. Wahl, B. Greenblatt, 11/18/1997. (43290 bytes)</A>
<dd>          This document defines a mechanism by which information servers can
    exchange indices of information from their databases by making use of
    the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP).  This document defines the 
    structure
    of the index information being exchanged, as well as a the appropriate
    meanings for the headers that are defined in the Common Indexing Proto-
    col.  It is assumed that the structures defined here can be used by
    X.500 DSAs, LDAP servers, Whois++ servers, CCSO servers and many 
    others.

"A CIP-based Centroid Exchange for LDAP", M. Wahl, 02/10/1997. (27923 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes how an LDAP server (the supplier) may transmit,
    through an out-of-band email, index information or attributes of its 
    naming context to another LDAP server (the consumer).  The consumer 
    server will make use of this information when determining whether the 
    supplier server is likely to have entries in that naming context which 
    match a particular search filter.  This assists the consumer in

"CIP Index Object Format for SOIF Objects", Mike Schwartz, D. Hardy, M.   Bowman, E. Hardie, Duane Wessels, 10/31/1997. (29451 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) allows servers to form a referral
    mesh for query handling by defining a mechanism by which cooperating
    servers exchange hints about the searchable indices they maintain.  The
    structure and transport of CIP are described in (Ref. 1), as are 
    general
    rules for the definition of index object types.  This document 
    describes
    SOIF, the Summary Object Interchange Format, as an index object type in
    the context of the CIP framework.  SOIF is a machine-readable syntax 
    for
    transmitting structured summary objects, currently used primarily in 
    the
    context of the World Wide Web.
     
    Query referral has often been dismissed as an ineffective strategy for
    handling searches of Web resources, and Web resources certainly present
    challenges not present in structured directory services like Rwhois.  
    In
    situations where a keyword-based free text search is desired, query
    referral is not likely to be effective because the query will probably
    be routed to every server participating in the referral mesh.  Where a
    search can be limited by reference to a specific resource attribute,
    however, query referral is an effective tool.  SOIF can be used to
    create such a known-attribute query mesh because it provides a method
    for associating attributes with net-addressable resources.
    
    Mic Bowman, Darren Hardy, Mike Schwartz, and Duane Wessels each
    contributed to the creation of the SOIF format and to the descriptions
    from which this draft is drawn; errors in this description of their 
    work
    are the responsibility of Edward Hardie and corrections should be
    directed accordingly.

"Hierarchical Extensions to the Common Indexing Protocol", Chris Weider,   P. Leach, 07/15/1997. (14930 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This work explores what, in the parlance of the current CIP draft, is 
    called an index type -- specifically, a new kind of index that merges 
    indexing of  hierarchically named attribute-value entities (such as in 
    LDAP and RWHOIS) and ones without distinguished names (such as in 
    WHOIS++). It is based on a previous version of the CIP specification, 
    but that was just a convenient syntactical jumping off point. It is 
    intended to be orthogonal to the FIND working group task of  defining a
    framing syntax and functionality for a common indexing data wrapping 
    protocol, and that the concepts and protocol elements in this draft 
    should be able to be expressed in a manner consistent with the new CIP 
    framework at the appropriate time.

"Registration Procedures for SOIF Template Types", E. Hardie, 05/27/1997. (14119 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Summary Object Interchange Format [Ref. 1] was first defined by the
    Harvest Project [Ref 2.] in January 1994.  SOIF was derived from a 
    combination of the Internet Anonymous FTP Archives IETF Working Group 
    (IAFA) templates [Ref 3.] and the BibTeX bibliography format [Ref 4.]. 
    The combination was originally noted for its advantages of providing a 
    convenient and intuitive way for delimiting objects within a stream, 
    and setting apart the URL for easy object access or invocation, while 
    still preserving compatibility with IAFA templates.              SOIF 
    uses named template types to indicate the attributes which may be 
    contained within a particular summary object.  Within the context of a 
    single application, private agreement on the definition of template 
    types has been adequate.  As SOIF objects are moved among applications,
    however, the need for standard, well-specified, and easily identifiable
    template types increases.  This need is particularly intense in the 
    context of query referral, where knowledge of an attribute's definition
    and the allowed data types for specific values is crucial.  For a 
    discussion of this in the context of the Common Indexing Protocol, see 
    [Ref. 1].

    routing is the process of redirecting and replicating queries through a

"LDAPv2 client Vs the Index Mesh", Roland Hedberg, 11/03/1997. (12871 bytes)</A>
<dd>        Since LDAP v2 clients implemented according to RFC 1777 [1] has no
       notion on referral. The integration between such a client and
       a Index mesh, as defined by the current Common Indexing Protocol
       draft [2], who heavily depends on referrals has to be handled
       in a somewhat special way. This document defines one possible
