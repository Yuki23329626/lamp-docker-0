"Cryptographic Message Syntax", Russ Housley, 11/14/1997. (40178 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This document describes the Cryptographic Message Syntax.  This
       syntax is used to digitally sign or encrypt arbitrary messages.
     
       The Cryptographic Message Syntax is derived from PKCS #7 version 
    1.5.
       Wherever possible, backward compatibility is preserved; however,
       changes were necessary to accomodate attribute certificate transfer
       and key agreement techniques for key management.
     
       This drfat obosletes the previously released <draft-housley-smime-
       cms-00.txt>.
     
       This draft is being discussed on the ''ietf-smime'' mailing list. To

"Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME", Paul Hoffman, 11/19/1997. (62388 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes three optional security service extensions for
    S/MIME. These services provide functionality that is similar to the 
    Message
    Security Protocol [MSP], but are useful in many other environments,
    particularly business and finance. The services are:
     - signed receipts
     - security labels
     - secure mailing lists
     
    The services described here are extensions to S/MIME version 2 [SMIME2]
    and
    S/MIME version 3 [SMIME3]. Most of this document can be used with 
    S/MIME
    version 2, which relies on PKCS #7 version 1.5 [PKCS7-1.5]. A small 
    number
    of the services require mechanisms described in Cryptographic Message
    Syntax [CMS].

"S/MIME Version 3 Certificate Handling", B. Ramsdell, 11/21/1997. (34045 bytes)</A>
<dd>     S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), described in
    [SMIME-MSG], provides a method to send and receive secure MIME
    messages. In order to validate the keys of a message sent to it, an
    S/MIME agent needs to certify that the key is valid. This draft
    describes the mechanisms S/MIME uses to create and validate keys using
    certificates.
     
    This specification is compatible with the Cryptographic Message Syntax
    [CMS] in that it uses the data types defined by CMS. It also inherits
    all the varieties of architectures for certificate-based key
    management supported by CMS. Note that the method S/MIME messages make
    certificate requests is defined in [SMIME-MSG].
     
    In order to handle S/MIME certificates, an agent has to follow
    specifications in this draft, as well as some of the specifications
    listed in the following documents:
     - ''PKCS #1: RSA Encryption'', [PKCS-1].
     - ''Cryptographic Message Syntax'', [CMS].
     - ''PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax'', [PKCS-10].

"S/MIME Version 3 Message Specification",, 11/21/1997. (62860 bytes)</A>
<dd>     S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a
    consistent way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on the
    popular Internet MIME standard, S/MIME provides the following
    cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications:
    authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation of origin (using
    digital signatures) and privacy and data security (using encryption).
     
    S/MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add
    cryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to interpret
    cryptographic security services in mail that is received. However,
    S/MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any transport
    mechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP. As such, S/MIME
    takes advantage of the object-based features of MIME and allows secure
    messages to be exchanged in mixed-transport systems.
     
    Further, S/MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that
    use cryptographic security services that do not require any human
    intervention, such as the signing of software-generated documents and
    the encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.

"Certificate Request Syntax", H. Prafullchandra, Barbara Fox, Xiaoyi Liu,  M. Myers, Jeff Weinstein, 11/26/1997. (50246 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document defines an Internet PKI Certificate Request Syntax (CRS).
    It addresses a growing need within the Internet PKI community for an
    interface to public key certification products and services based on
    PKCS7 [PKCS7] and PKCS10 [PKCS10]. A small number of additional 
    services
    are defined to supplement the core certificate request service. Current
    industry practice regarding the use of PKCS7 and PKCS10 is also
    documented for the benefit of the Internet community.
     
    In general, the use of PKCS7 in this document is aligned to the
    Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] which provides a superset of the
    PKCS7 syntax.  Throughout this document, the term CMS should be taken 
    to
    include the PKCS #7 document as defined in [PKCS7].  The term CRS 
    refers
    to this specification.
     
    The chief differences between CRS and PKIXMGMT are:
     
    - Use of PKCS7 for security encapsulation and transaction framework
    - Use of PKCS10 as the certification request message content
    - Certification of Diffie-Hellman Public Keys based on PKCS10 requests
    - No assumption of reliable connectivity or persistent on-line 
    operation
    - Single request/response transaction model
