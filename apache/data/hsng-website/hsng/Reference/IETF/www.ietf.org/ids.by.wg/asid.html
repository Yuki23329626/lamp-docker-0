"A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information", Tim Howes, Mark Smith,   Frank Dawson  Jr., 11/18/1997. (57392 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document defines a MIME Content-Type for holding directory 
    informa-
    tion.  The definition is independent of any particular directory 
    service
    or protocol.  The text/directory Content-Type is defined for  holding  
    a
    variety  of  directory information, for example, name, or email 
    address,
    or logo. The text/directory Content-Type can also be used  as  the  
    root
    body  part in a multipart/related Content-Type for handling more 
    compli-
    cated situations, especially those in which non-textual information 
    that
    already  has a natural MIME representation, for example, a photograph 
    or
    sound, must be represented.
     
    The text/directory Content-Type defines a general framework  and  
    format
    for  holding  directory  information  in  a  simple  ''type: value'' 
    form.
    
    Mechanisms are defined to specify  alternate  languages,  encodings  
    and
    other  meta-information.  This  document  also  defines the procedure 
    by
    which particular formats, called  profiles,  for  carrying  
    application-
    specific information within a text/directory Content-Type may be 
    defined
    and registered, and the conventions such  formats  must  follow.  It  
    is
    expected  that other documents will be produced that define such 
    formats
    for various applications (e.g., white pages).

"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3):  Extensions for Dynamic   Directory Services", Tony Genovese, M. Wahl, Y. Yaacovi, 09/29/1997. (23415 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This document defines the requirements for dynamic directory 
    services
       and specifies the format of request and response extended operations
       for supporting client-server interoperation in a dynamic directories
       environment. 
     
       The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] supports
       lightweight access to static directory services, allowing relatively
       fast search and update access.  Static directory services store
       information about people that persists in its accuracy and value 
    over
       a long period of time.
      
       Dynamic directory services are different in that they store
       information that only persists in its accuracy and value when it is
       being periodically refreshed.  This information is stored as dynamic
       entries in the directory.  A typical use will be a client or a 
    person
       that is either online - in which case it has an entry in the
       directory, or is offline - in which case its entry disappears from 
    the
       directory.  Though the protocol operations and attributes used by
       dynamic directory services are similar to the ones used for static
       directory services, clients that store dynamic information in the
       directory need to periodically refresh this information, in order to
       prevent it from disappearing.  If dynamic entries are not refreshed
       within a given timeout, they will be removed from the directory.  
    For
       example, this will happen if the client that set them goes offline.
     
       A flow control mechanism from the server is also described that 
    allows
       a server to inform clients how often they should refresh their
       presence.

<dd>     The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [1] provides a means for

    This document describes how language codes [3] are carried in LDAP and 
    are to be interpreted by LDAP servers.  All implementations MUST be

"The LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) - Technical Specification", G.   Good, 07/25/1997. (22076 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes a file format suitable for describing directory
    information or modifications made to directory information.  The file 
    format, known as LDIF, for LDAP Data Interchange Format, is typically 
    used to import and export directory information between LDAP-based 
    directory servers, or to describe a set of changes which are to be 
    applied to a directory.                                                
    There are a number of situations where a common interchange format is 
    desirable.  For example, one might wish to export a copy of the 
    contents of a directory server to a file, move that file to a different
    machine, and import the contents into a second directory server.    
    Additionally, by using a well-defined interchange format, development 
    of data import tools from legacy systems is facilitated.  A fairly 
    simple set of tools written in awk or perl can, for example, convert a 
    database of personnel information into an LDIF file, which can then be 
    imported into a directory server, regardless of the internal database 
    representation the target directory server uses.   The key words 
    'MUST', 'MAY', and 'SHOULD' used in this document are to be interpreted

"The String Representation of LDAP Search Filters", Tim Howes,   10/20/1997. (10292 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] defines a network 
    representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP server.  Some 
    applications may find it useful to have a common way of representing 
    these search filters in a human-readable form.  This document defines a
    human-readable string format for representing LDAP search filters.     
    This document replaces RFC 1960, extending the string LDAP filter 
    definition to include support for LDAP version 3 extended match 
    filters, and including support for representing the full range of 
    possible LDAP search filters.

"LDAP-based Routing of SMTP Messages: Approach Used by Netscape", H.   Lachman, 03/26/1997. (33895 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
    (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store 
    information about users and other network entities.  One of the many 
    possible uses of a directory service is to store information about 
    users' email accounts, such as their email addresses, and how messages 
    addressed to them should be routed.  In the interest of 
    interoperability, it is desirable to have a common schema for such 
    email-related information.      This document discusses some of the 
    fundamental questions to be considered in the development of a common 
    schema for LDAP-based routing of SMTP [3] messages, presents an 
    approach that has been implemented and deployed, and discusses possible
    extensions to that approach that may serve to make it more complete and
    general.  The intent is to provide information about an existing 
    implementation, and to stimulate discussion about whether and how to 
    standardize the relevant aspects of LDAP-based messaging management.

"LDAP-based Routing of SMTP Messages: Approach at Stanford University",   J. Hodges, B. Bense, 03/27/1997. (17055 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The 'Internet X.500 Schema' defines an RFC-822 email address attribute 
    of a person's entry, rfc822Mailbox (aka 'Mail'), but it does not 
    address the issues involved in routing RFC-822-based email within an 
    administrative domain served by an X.500/LDAP-based directory service. 
    Significantly, it doesn't delineate between a person's publicaly 
    'advertised' or 'promoted' email address and the actual 'internal to 
    the administrative domain' address for the person.                     
    This memo illustrates an object class and an attendant attribute we use
    at Stanford University to solve this issue. This scheme provides us 
    with flexible, simple to implement, distributed routing of 
    RFC-822-based email to people represented by entries within our 
    directory service. The LDAP-enabled version of sendmail we use is 
    freely available.               Additionally, we anticipate that the 
    Internet community will devise conventions and perhaps support a 
    process for facilitating multi-vendor directory utilization. We present
    an anticipated tenet and goals.

"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol:  Dynamic Attributes", Tony   Genovese, M. Wahl, Y. Yaacovi, 11/21/1997. (21108 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This document defines dynamic attributes and the fashion in which 
    they
       are being set and used on entries in the directory.  This document
       builds heavily on the dynamic extensions to LDAP infrastructure as
       defined in [1].
     
       The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [2] supports
       lightweight access to static directory services, allowing relatively
       fast search and update access.  Static directory services store
       information about people that persists in its accuracy and value 
    over
       a long period of time.
    
       The dynamic extension to LDAP as defined in [1] added the concept of
       dynamic entries that only persist in the directory, when they are
       periodically refreshed.  This document takes this approach one step
       farther and defines how dynamic attributes can be used, on either
       static or dynamic entries, to handle up-to-date and dynamic
       information about an entry in the directory.  An example use will be
    a
       client or a person that has a static entry in the directory and
       sometimes goes online, which is reflected in the 'online' attribute
       for the entry.  To specify whether this person is online or offline 
    -
       an attribute that changes frequently, a client application will have
       to modify this attribute relatively frequently.  The current 
    location
       of a person is another attribute that may change frequently.
     
       Dynamic attributes must be periodically refreshed.  Otherwise, they
       will disappear from the directory over time.

"The vCard Schema For Use In LDAPv3", F. Dawson, M. O'Brien, 07/08/1997. (41824 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAPV3] is gaining 
    widespread acceptance as a method for accessing Internet directories.  
    Many of the LDAP clients accessing these directories also provide 
    support for emitting the directory information in the form of a vCard 
    electronic business card object. This memo defines a new X.500 object 
    class, called the vCardObject, that extends the X.521 standard 
    organizationalPerson and residentialPerson in order to provide a unique
    LDAP schema for accessing  Internet directories in terms of the vCard 
    attributes.                     The schema defined by this memo should 
    be used when accessing a directory via LDAP Version 3 and searching or 
    retrieving directory information based on vCard related attributes. The
    schema describes the attribute types and object classes that have a 
    1-to-one correspondence with vCard properties.  This schema may also be
    used to define a set of object classes and attributes for storing 
    metadata and binding information for a directory entry that closely 
    follows the vCard object in directories that support LDAP.
