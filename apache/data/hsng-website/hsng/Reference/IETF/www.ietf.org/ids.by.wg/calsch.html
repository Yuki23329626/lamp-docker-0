"Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification   (iCalendar)", F. Dawson, D. Stenerson, 10/31/1997. (181218 bytes)</A>
<dd>        There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable 
    calendaring
       and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
       and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being 
    extended
       for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This memo
       has been defined to provide the a definition of a common format for
       openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
       Internet.
     
       This memo is formatted as a registration for a MIME media type per
       [RFC 2048]. However, the format in this memo is equally applicable
       for use outside of a MIME message content type.
     
       The proposed media type value is ''TEXT/CALENDAR''. This string 
    would
       label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information
       encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below.
     
       This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
       calendar event and to-do information. It also can be used to convey
       free/busy time information. The content type is suitable as a MIME
       message entity that can be transferred over MIME based email systems
       or using HTTP. In addition, the content type is useful as an object 
    for interactions between desktop applications using the operating
       system clipboard, drag/drop or file systems capabilities.
     
       This memo is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar 
    specification
       for the exchange of personal calendaring and scheduling information.
       In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work, this memo is
       to be known as the iCalendar specification. This memo is based on 
    the
       calendaring and scheduling model defined in []. The document is also
       the basis for the calendaring and scheduling interoperability
       protocol defined in [ITIP].
     
       This memo also includes the format for defining iCalendar object
       methods. An iCalendar object method is a set of usage constraints 
    for
       the iCalendar object. For

"Calendaring Interoperability over HTTP (CIH)", S. Hanna, 02/10/1997. (12911 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Calendaring Interoperability over HTTP (CIH) is a technique for 
    exchanging calendaring information between scheduling systems using the
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows users to schedule 
    meetings with anyone else, no matter what scheduling software they use.
    This document is a tentative exploration of whether CIH is feasible and
    what the pros and cons are relative to a brand new protocol like the 
    Calendaring Interoperability Protocol (CIP). The primary benefit of CIH
    over CIP and motivation for this project is that we avoid implementing 
    a whole new protocol, such as writing and debugging the protocol, 
    convincing vendors to write new code to support it, and then convincing
    users to deploy it.

"Real-time Protocol Requirements", Anik Ganguly, 03/28/1997. (5843 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The purpose of this document is to create a framework for selecting the
    appropriate solution for a real-time protocol designed to allow 
    calendaring and scheduling systems from different vendors to 
    interoperate.  To that end, it describes the assumptions about the 
    context in which this protocol will operate, and the requirements that 
    the protocol must meet.   These requirements are not intended to apply 
    to a companion protocol which will use E-mail based transport to 
    achieve interoperability.  The E-mail based protocol, which is the 
    subject of a different document, will not make any assumptions about 
    transport latency.

<dd>        This document specifies a binding from the iCalendar Transport-
       independent Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to Internet email-based

"Internet Calendar Model Specification", John Noerenberg, 11/17/1997. (41223 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols require the definition of
    objects to encapsulate an event to be scheduled, a calendar on which
    the event will be stored, and means for exchanging these objects across
    the Internet between calendars on behalf of people for whom the
    calendars are meaningful.  This document gives an abstract model of the
    objects and the protocols necessary to accomplish this kind of
    information exchange.  It will establish the context in which other
    Calendaring and Scheduling RFCs can be interpreted.  Included are brief
    introductions to the other components of Internet calendar protocols
    and definitions of nomenclature common to all documents defining these
    protocols.  Reading this document will enable implementors and users of
    Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols to understand the goals
    and constraints chosen for related protocols.

"iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)   Scheduling Events, BusyTime, To-dos and Journal Entries", R. Hopson, S.   Mansour, Frank Dawson  Jr., S. Silverberg, 10/28/1997. (188651 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document specifies how calendaring systems use iCalendar objects
       to interoperate with other calendar systems. It does so in a general
       way so as to allow multiple methods of communication between 
    systems.
       Subsequent documents specify interoperable methods of communications
       between systems that use this protocol.
     
       The document outlines a model for calendar exchange that defines 
    both
       static and dynamic event, to-do, journal and free/busy objects.
       Static objects are used to transmit information from one entity to
       another without the expectation of continuity or referential
       integrity with the original item. Dynamic objects are a superset of
       static objects and will gracefully degrade to their static
       counterparts for clients that only support static objects.
