"A Framework for Inter-Domain Route Aggregation", J. Stewart, E. Chen,   07/30/1997. (25409 bytes)</A>
<dd>     
       This document presents a framework for inter-domain route 
    aggregation
       and shows an example router configuration which 'implement' this
       framework.  This framework is flexible and scales well as it
       emphasizes the philosophy of aggregation by the source, both within
       routing domains as well as towards upstream providers, and it also
       strongly encourages the use of the 'no-export' BGP community to
       balance the provider-subscriber need for more granular routing
       information with the Internet's need for scalable inter-domain
       routing.

<dd>        Route aggregation is critical to the long-term viability of the
       Internet.  This document presents practical information that network
       managers can use to both understand the concepts of aggregation as
       well as put those concepts into use in order to do their part to 
    make
       the Internet stable and allow its continued growth.  The intended
       audience for this document is anyone responsible for configuring a
       network which has its own Autonomous System Number (ASN) and
       exchanges routing information with its Internet Service Provider(s)
       (ISP(s)) using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  This document 
    does
       not cover multi-homing, though multi-homed sites can still benefit
       from understanding this material.

"Using a Dedicated AS for Sites Homed to a Single Provider", E. Chen, T.   Bates, R. Chandra, John Stewart  III, 07/30/1997. (10193 bytes)</A>
<dd>        With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers
       using BGP4 has grown significantly. RFC1930 outlines a set of guide-
       lines for when one needs and should use an AS. However, the customer
       and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a result of
       this in that while there is no need for an allocated AS under the
       guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very pragmatic
       and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a single ISP.
       This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with 
    recommen-
       dations set forth in RFC1930.

"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4", D Katz, Y Rekhter, T. Bates, R.   Chandra, 09/26/1997. (17248 bytes)</A>
<dd>        Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] is capable of carrying routing information
       only for IPv4 [IPv4]. This document defines extensions to BGP-4 to
       enable it to carry routing information for multiple Network Layer
       protocols (e.g., IPv6, IPX, etc...). The extensions are backward
       compatible - a router that supports the extensions can interoperate
       with a router that doesn't support the extensions.

"Capabilities Negotiation with BGP-4", J. Scudder, R. Chandra,   09/09/1997. (6228 bytes)</A>
<dd>        Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] requires that when a BGP speaker receives an
       OPEN message with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the
       speaker must terminate BGP peering. This complicates introduction of
       new capabilities in BGP.
         
       This document defines new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities,
       that is expected to facilitate introduction of new capabilities in
       BGP by providing graceful capability negotiation.
         
       The proposed parameter is backward compatible - a router that
       supports the parameter can maintain BGP peering with a router that
       doesn't support the parameter.

"BGP Route Flap Damping", C. Villamizar, R. Govindan, R. Chandra,   11/05/1997. (59707 bytes)</A>
<dd>     A usage of the BGP routing protocol is described which is capable of
      reducing the routing traffic passed on to routing peers and therefore
      the load on these peers without adversely affecting route convergence
      time for relatively stable routes.  This technique has been
      implemented in commercial products supporting BGP. The technique is
      also applicable to IDRP.
     
      The overall goals are:
     
     
     
      o  to provide a mechanism capable of reducing router processing load 
    caused by instability
     
      o  in doing so prevent sustained routing oscillations
     
      o  to do so without sacrificing route convergence time for generally
         well behaved routes.
     
     
     
      This must be accomplished keeping other goals of BGP in mind:
     
     
     
      o  pack changes into a small number of updates
     
      o  preserve consistent routing
     
      o  minimal addition space and computational overhead
     
     
      Excessive updates to reachability state has been widespread in the
      Internet.  This observation was made in the early 1990s by many 
    people
      involved in Internet operations and remains to case to date.  These  
    excessive updates are not necessarily periodic so route oscillation
      would be a misleading term.  The informal term used to describe this
      effect is ``route flap''.  The techniques described here are now
      widely deployed and are commonly referred to as ``route flap
      damping''.                                                           (This Internet-Draft is also available in

<dd>        BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions [BGP-MP] defines the format of two

       attributes for the purpose of conveying IPv6 routing information.
