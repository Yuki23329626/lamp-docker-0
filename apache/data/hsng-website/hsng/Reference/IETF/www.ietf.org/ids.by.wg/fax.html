"Requirements for Internet Fax", Larry Masinter, 11/24/1997. (31209 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Facsimile (Fax) has a long tradition of being a telephony application
    from one terminal device to another, where the terminal device
    consists of a paper input device (scanner), a paper output device
    (printer), and a limited amount of processing power. The transmission
    of data end-to-end is accompanied by negotiation (to ensure that the
    scanned data can be rendered at the recipient) and confirmation of
    delivery (to give the sender assurance that the final data has been
    received and processed.)  Over time, facsimile has been extended to
    allow for PCs connected running software to send and receive fax, to
    send data other than paper images, as well as many extensions to the
    basic image model, e.g., recent ITU fax standards for color fax.
    Other delivery extensions have included sub-addressing (additional
    signals after the call is established to facilitate automated routing
    of faxes to desktops or mailboxes), and enhanced features such as
    fax-back, polling, and even the transfer of binary files.
     
    Many mechanisms for sending fax documents over the Internet have been
    demonstrated and deployed and are currently in use.
     
    This document summarizes the requirements for Internet Fax as
    discussed in the IETF Internet Fax working group. It is an attempt to
    establish a baseline of agreed-to requirements against which any
    proposal for Internet Fax can be judged.  This document encompasses the
    requirements for both 'real-time' fax as well as 'store and forward'
    fax (both terms defined in Section 2).
