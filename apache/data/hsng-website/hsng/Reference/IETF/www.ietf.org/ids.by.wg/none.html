"Mail Ubiquitous Security Extensions (MUSE)", Don Eastlake, 05/12/1997. (47852 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Secure electronic mail can provide authentication of the source of mail
    and confidentiality for its contents.  These features are becoming 
    increasingly important as the Internet grows exponentially and email is
    increasingly used for critical, sensitive, and confidential 
    communications.  In addition, authentication can make mail filtering 
    more effective and ubiquitous encryption indirectly makes all mail more
    secure be defeating traffic analysis based on distinctions between 
    encrypted and non-encrypted mail and defeating bulk searching through 
    insecure mail. However, use of secure mail is not widespread due to the
    problems of key distribution and lack of migration to secure mail 
    enabled user agents.  This draft proposes partial solutions to these 
    two problems by using coarser grained identity to permit some 
    authentication and confidentiality without user agent change, and 
    secure DNS for key distribution.  These changes also support limited 
    host and domain level mail security policies.

"Netstrings", D. Bernstein, 02/03/1997. (5613 bytes)</A>
<dd>     A netstring is a self-delimiting encoding of a string. Netstrings are 
    very easy to generate and to parse. Any string may be encoded as a 
    netstring; there are no restrictions on length or on allowed bytes. 
    Another virtue of a netstring is that it declares the string size up 
    front. Thus an application can check in advance whether it has enough 
    space to store the entire string.                                      
    Netstrings may be used as a basic building block for reliable network 
    protocols. Most high-level protocols, in effect, transmit a sequence of
    strings; those strings may be encoded as netstrings and then 
    concatenated into a sequence of characters, which in turn may be 
    transmitted over a reliable stream protocol such as TCP.

"Tools in the War on Mail Loops", D. Bernstein, 02/03/1997. (17277 bytes)</A>
<dd>     An automailer means any program that receives a mail message and 
    automatically sends one or more mail messages. This term is meant to 
    include not only a mail-based server, such as a mailing list exploder 
    or a vacation program, but also an SMTP server, which receives a 
    message from the network and relays it to a local or remote user.      
    In a network full of automailers, any mistake can cause a mail loop.  
    Since some automailers generate several outputs in response to a single
    input, a loop can produce an exponential explosion of mail.            
    All the automailers in the qmail package follow a general philosophy 
    designed to prevent mail loops and limit the damage from any loops that
    do occur. These automailers have been repeatedly observed to fail safe:
    they stop loops in the face of typical failures by other hosts. This 
    document explains the philosophy and describes the automailers.

"Notice-Requested-Upon-Delivery-To (NRUDT)", D. Bernstein, 02/03/1997. (5459 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The UNIX sendmail program has for many years supported a 
    Return-Receipt-To (RRT) header field that requests a notice of 
    successful final delivery.    Notice-Requested-Upon-Delivery-To (NRUDT)
    has the same basic function. The big difference is that RRT lists the 
    sender's address, while NRUDT lists the recipient's address.           
    This change is critical. RRT works poorly for messages to multiple 
    recipients, because it requests a notice from every recipient. RRT in a
    message to a large mailing list produces a giant, usually 
    unintentional, flood of mail. This problem is so severe that RRT has 
    been disabled in recent versions of sendmail.                          
    NRUDT is designed to be adopted immediately, with minimal disruption, 
    as a solution to the problems of RRT. Note that NRUDT is merely a

<dd>     The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) supports two commands that list files:

<dd>     The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file 
    transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a 
    remote host.  One of its primary uses is the booting of diskless nodes 
    on a Local Area Network.  TFTP is used because it is very simple to 
    implement in a small node's limited ROM space.  However, the choice of 
    a 512-octet blocksize is not the most efficient for use on a LAN whose 
    MTU may 1500 octets or greater.

    start-of-session authentication for firewall proxies, dial-up Network
    Access Servers, remote email servers, and interactive protocols such as
    Telnet and FTP. It provides functionality similar to One Time Passwords
    and handheld authentication tokens, and it supports both one-way and

    in ISO/IEC 9798-3 and NIST FIPS Pub 196.
     
    The PKL protocol provides strong authentication at the beginning of a

    integrity mechanism, for example to provide authentication of

<dd>          A class of special-purpose computers has evolved to provide voice
         messaging services.  These machines generally interface to a 
    telephone
         switch and provide call answering and voice messaging services.
         Traditionally, messages sent to a non-local machine are 
    transported
         using analog networking protocols based on DTMF signaling and 
    analog
         voice playback.  As the demand for networking increases, there is 
    a
         need for a standard high-quality digital protocol to connect these
         machines.  The following document is a profile of the Internet
         standard MIME and ESMTP protocols for use as a digital voice 
    messaging
         networking protocol. The profile is referred to as VPIM (Voice 
    Profile
         for Internet Mail) in this document.
     
     
         This profile is based on earlier work in the Audio Message 
    Interchange
         Specification (AMIS) group that defined a voice messaging protocol
         based on X.400 technology.  This profile is intended to satisfy

<dd>     A contributing factor to the explosive growth in IP address allocation 
    is the coming together of two seeming unrelated factors.  One factor is
    arbitrary relationship within the Domain Name Server that requires an 
    unique IP address to be associated with a Domain Name.  The second 
    factor is the public's desire to have short Domain Names unique to 
    their enterprise.                                                      
    We believe a small modification to the Domain Name Server will break 
    this relationship and lessen pressure on IP address allocation.  This 
    modification should also make system configuration easier than dealing 
    with IP addresses for each Domain Name supported on a given host.      
    One difficulty with the proposed modification is that similar 'small' 
    changes are required in the WWW browsers to pick up the port number and

       this document allow a mobile node out on a public sector of the
       internet to negotiate access past a SKIP firewall, and construct a

       In addition to securing traffic, our mechanisms allow a mobile node

    for the DVMRP capable egress routers; - support for a multicast group

       Routers', or 'LSRs'.  In order to transmit a labeled packet on a
       particular data link, an LSR must support an encoding technique
       which, given a label stack and a network layer packet, produces a
       labeled packet.  This document specifies the encoding to be used by
       an LSR in order to transmit labeled packets on PPP data links and on
       LAN data links.  This document also specifies rules and procedures
       for processing the various fields of the label stack encoding.

"The Weak Authentication and Tracing Option", Don Eastlake, 11/26/1997. (42470 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The packet switched nature of the Internet Protocol (IP) provides no
       inherent method to assure that a packet has been issued with a 
    source
       address authorized for the sender and no inherent method to trace 
    the
       actual source of a packet.  These characteristics make it difficult
       to take effective action concerning injurious packets which may have
       originated, by accident or maliciously, virtually anywhere in the
       Internet.
     
       A lightweight IP level option is proposed that provides (1) some
       assurance that packet's source addresses are authorized for their
       sender, and (2) limited statistical tracing information such that, 
    if
       many bad packets are logged, the path to their source will be
       revealed.

      being made within SC6 to come up with a new transport service
      definition meeting the wide range of requirements of the both current

    scalability problems.     Moreover, the creation of short-cut VCs 
    itself suffers a scalability issue.    But, CSRs (Cell Switching

    end-to-end cell-by-cell relaying over IP routers. That is, there is no 
    reason to have LISes and there is no inefficiency     The way to go for

"Securing FTP with TLS", E. Murray, P. Ford-Hutchinson, T. Hudson,   08/01/1997. (46444 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This document describes a mechanism that can be used by FTP clients
       and servers to implement security and authentication using the TLS
       protocol defined by the IETF TLS working group and the extensions to
       the FTP protocol defined by the IETF CAT working group.  It 
    describes
       the subset of the extensions that are required and the parameters to
       be used; discusses some of the policy issues that clients and 
    servers
       will need to take; considers some of the implications of those
       policies and discusses some expected behaviours of implementations 
    to
       allow interoperation.
     
       TLS is not the only mechanism for securing file transfer, however it
       does offer some of the following positive attributes:-
    
          - Flexible security levels.  TLS can support privacy, integrity,
          authentication or some combination of all of these.  This allows
          clients and servers to dynamically, during a session, decide on
          the level of security required for a particular data transfer,
     
          - Formalised public key management.  By use of X.509 public
          certificates during the authentication phase, certificate
          management can be built into a central function.  Whilst this may
          not be desirable for all uses of secured file transfer, it offers
          advantages in certain structured environments such as access to
          corporate data sources.
     
          - Co-existence and interoperation with authentication mechanisms
          that are already in place for the HTTPS protocol.  This allows 
    web
          browsers to incorporate secure file transfer using the same
          infrastructure that has been set up to allow secure web browsing.
     
       The TLS protocol is a development of the Netscape Communication
       Corporation's SSL protocol and this document can be used to allow 
    the
       FTP protocol to be used with either SSL or TLS.  The actual protocol
       used will be decided by the negotiation of the protected session by
       the TLS/S

"Proposal of a suggested protocol for an interactive, real-time   cryptographic 'key' server", D. Merriman, 01/03/1997. (11828 bytes)</A>
<dd>     With the increase in privacy-enabling cryptographic software, there 
    exists the growing problem of verification of the 'validity' of a 
    cryptographic 'key'. That is, the recipient of (for example) a 
    PGP-signed email message from an unknown person generally has no ready,
    convenient means to verify that the 'signature' on the message actually
    belongs to the sender. To verify the relationship between a 
    cryptographic 'key' and an identity (real or anonymous), it is 
    necessary for an individual to contact one of several existing 'manual'
    keyservers as a separate process, request the key (if it exists on that
    keyserver), and retrieve it before being able to use it for any 
    reference or validation purposes.          This draft is meant to 
    propose a protocol/system that would both enable the automatic 
    retrieval of cryptographic keys, and the exchange of keys between 
    servers (both new keys, and those deleted through revocation 
    certificates). This proposal could be extended to allow retrieval of 
    cryptographic certificates and/or 'credentials' with relatively minor 
    difficulty.

<dd>     This document provides an overview of tag switching. Tag switching is a
    way to combine the label-swapping forwarding paradigm with network 
    layer routing. This has several advantages. Tags can have a wide 
    spectrum of forwarding granularities, so at one end of the spectrum a 
    tag could be associated with a group of destinations, while at the 
    other a tag could be associated with a single application flow. At the 
    same time forwarding based on tag switching, due to its simplicity, is 
    well suited to high performance forwarding. These factors facilitate 
    the development of a routing system which is both functionally rich and
    scalable. Finally, tag switching simplifies integration of routers and 
    ATM switches by employing common addressing, routing, and management 
    procedures.

    design draws off the fact that many security systems already have 
    flexible name schemes, and are therefore considered components which

    service, flexibility and reliability, while introducing many desirable

"The Multicast Attribute Framing Protocol", Ross Finlayson, 11/26/1997. (15265 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The Internet has recently seen the emergence of applications that 
    involve
    the ongoing transmission, or ''pushing'', of structured data from a 
    server to
    one or more client nodes.  Most current applications send this data 
    using
    unicast communications - usually over TCP connections.  However, 
    similar
    applications can also be implemented using multicast-based protocols.
    Multicast not only improves the scalability of this particular class of
    application, but also makes possible an additional class of application
    in
    which the participants can act as peers - sending data as well as 
    receiving.
     
    This Internet Draft describes the ''Multicast Attribute Framing 
    Protocol''
    (MAFP) - a generic, attribute-based data representation, intended for a
    wide
    variety of multicast-based applications.  It is currently being used to
    implement the ''multikit'' generic multicast session browser
    (http://www.lvn.com/multikit).  This draft describes an early version 
    of
    MAFP that is likely to undergo substantial changes in the future.  
    However,
    it is being described now, in the hope that it will promote open 
    discussion
    of this and similar protocols - ideally leading to the adoption of an 
    open,
    interoperable standard for this class of application.

"AT&T/Neda's Efficient Short Remote Operations (ESRO) Protocol   Specification Version 1.2", M. Banan, J. Cheng, M. Taylor, 09/11/1997. ( bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document specifies the service model, the notation and protocol 
    for Efficient Short Remote Operations (ESRO). The ESRO service is 
    similar to and is consistent with other Remote Procedure Call services.
    The emphasis of ESRO service definition and the ESRO protocol is on 
    efficiency.  ESRO is designed specifically with wireless network (e.g.,
    CDPD) usage in mind. ESRO protocol provides reliable connectionless 
    remote operation services on top of UDP (or any other non-reliable 
    connectionless transport service) with minimum overhead.  ESRO protocol
    supports segmentation and reassembly, concatenation and separation as 
    well as multiplexing for service users (applications).            ESRO 
    allows for trade-offs between efficiency and reliability by specifying 
    both 2-way hand-shake and 3-way hand-shake based protocols.     
    Encoding mechanisms for presentation of the parameters of remote 
    operations are outside the scope of this document.  But, identification
    (tagging) of the encoding mechanism in use (e.g., XDR, BER, PER) is 
    supported by ESRO protocol.    A variety of applications can use the 
    ESRO protocol.  Some early applications using ESRO include efficient 
    short message submission and delivery, credit card

"IMAP4 Referrals", M. Gahrns, 04/22/1997. (19180 bytes)</A>
<dd>     When dealing with large amounts of users, messages and geographically 
    dispersed IMAP4 [RFC-2060] servers, it is often desirable to distribute
    messages amongst different servers within an organization.  For example
    an administrator may choose to store user's personal mailboxes on a 
    local IMAP4 server, while storing shared mailboxes remotely on another 
    server.  This type of configuration is common when it is uneconomical 
    to store all data centrally due to limited bandwidth or disk resources.
    Additionally, users may be frequently moved from one IMAP4 server to 
    another because of hardware failures or organizational changes.        
    Referrals allow clients to seamlessly access mailboxes that are 
    distributed across several IMAP4 servers or to transparently connect to
    an alternate IMAP4 server.                                             
    A referral mechanism can provide efficiencies over the alternative 
    'proxy method', in which the local IMAP4 server contacts the remote 
    server on behalf of the client, and then transfers the data from the 
    remote server to itself, and then on to the client.  The referral

<dd>     The cause of the typically glacial response from popular Internet World
    Wide Web servers is seldom lack of network bandwidth or any deficits in

"Fine-Grained Transclusion in the Hypertext Markup Language", A. Pam,   02/25/1997. (7200 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The word 'hypertext' was coined by Theodor Holm Nelson in his paper 'A 
    File Structure for the Complex, the Changing and the Indeterminate', 
    presented at the ACM 20th national conference in 1965.  One of the key 
    concepts in Nelson's vision of hypertext is 'transclusion' or virtual 
    inclusion, which permits composite documents to be constructed by 
    reference to the original components rather than by copying.           
    The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to 
    create hypertext documents that are platform independent.  HTML

"Simple Integrated Media Access (SIMA)", K. Kilkki, 06/18/1997. (61961 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The basic objectives of future Internet are to increase the network 
    capacity, to offer a practical real-time service, and to develop a 
    feasible charging scheme. These objectives introduce very strict 
    requirements for the traffic control system. This paper presents a new 
    simple approach for traffic management: Simple Integrated Media Access 
    (SIMA) service. According to the SIMA concept each customer shall 
    define only two issues before a connection establishment: a nominal bit
    rate (NBR) and the selection between real-time and non-real-time 
    service classes. NBR has two purposes: it forms the basis of charging, 
    and it defines how the network capacity is divided among different 
    connections during overload situations. Simplicity means that, on the 
    one hand, the network operator does not guarantee the continuous 
    availability of network operator does not guarantee the continuous 
    availability of nominal bit rate, and on the other hand, the user is 
    allowed to send data with any bit rate independently of the NBR. 
    However, the bit rate of transmission defines the cell loss probability
    in the case of network congestion. In this way a simple, but effective,
    self-regulation of traffic can be

<dd>        The mailing list command specification header fields are a simple

       List-Subscribe, and List-Unsubscribe.

       not as widely applicable, will have utility for a sufficient number
       of mailing lists to justify their formalization here. These are
       List-Post, List-Owner and List-Archive.

"S/MIME Version 2 Message Specification", S. Dusse, L. Lundblade, Paul   Hoffman, L. Repka, B. Ramsdell, 11/20/1997. (60855 bytes)</A>
<dd>     S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a 
    consistent
    way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on the popular Internet
    MIME standard, S/MIME provides the following cryptographic security
    services for electronic messaging applications: authentication, message
    integrity and non-repudiation of origin (using digital signatures) and
    privacy and data security (using encryption).
     
    S/MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add
    cryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to interpret
    cryptographic security services in mail that is received. However, 
    S/MIME
    is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any transport mechanism 
    that
    transports MIME data, such as HTTP. As such, S/MIME takes advantage of 
    the
    object-based features of MIME and allows secure messages to be 
    exchanged in
    mixed-transport systems.
     
    Further, S/MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that 
    use
    cryptographic security services that do not require any human 
    intervention,
    such as the signing of software-generated documents and the encryption 
    of
    FAX messages sent over the Internet.

    described in [1]) leads to a multicast traffic scoping mechanism that 
    is superior to the original 'TTL scoping' mechanism.                   
    Contrary to popular opinion, however, administrative (often abbreviated
    as 'admin') scoping does not truly *replace* TTL scoping.  In 
    particular, multicast-based applications must still be aware of which 
    TTL value(s) they use.                                                 
    In this document, we note that each definition of a range of admin 
    scoped multicast addresses should be accompanied by a corresponding 
    'maximum effective TTL' that should be used with these addresses.  We 
    describe how these TTL values are used by applications, and how they 
    may influence the configuration of multicast border routers.

"The Receiver-Initiated Shortcut Path Protocol (RISP)", Y. Chen, J.   Ogawa, 08/28/1997. (33681 bytes)</A>
<dd>          This memo defines the Receiver Initiated Shortcut Path (RISP)
         protocol for NBMA networks.  The protocol extends the NHRP message
         set by adding Callback Request and Reply messages to allow the
         destination host (or its corresponding egress router) to establish
         a shortcut path for a data flow, using the existing NBMA signaling
         protocols.  Because of this receiver-initiated mechanism, a
         shortcut-capable network can use just the NBMA ARP servers, such 
    as
         the ATMARP servers, instead of the more complex Next Hop
         Servers. This draft also describes how to extend NHRP with the 
    new,
         receiver-initiated mechanism.

"RETHER : A Protocol for Real-Time Traffic Support on Ethernet", C.   Venkatramani, T. Chiueh, 04/14/1997. (53096 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Distributed multimedia applications require performance guarantees from
    the underlying network subsystem. Ethernet has been the dominant local 
    area network architecture in the last decade, and we believe that it 
    will remain popular because of its cost-effectiveness and the 
    availability of higher-bandwidth Ethernets. We present the design of a 
    software-based timed-token protocol called RETHER that provides 
    real-time performance guarantees to multimedia applications without 
    requiring any modifications to existing Ethernet hardware. RETHER 
    features a hybrid mode of operation to reduce the performance impact on
    non-real-time network traffic, a race-condition-free distributed 
    admission control mechanism, and an efficient token-passing scheme that
    protects the network against token loss due to node failures or 
    otherwise. Performance measurements from a prototype running on 10-Mbps
    Ethernet and 100-Mbps Fast-Ethernet indicate that up to 60 of the raw 
    bandwidth can be reserved without deteriorating the performance of 
    non-real-time traffic significantly.  This scheme is consistent with 
    the ISSLL over LANs framework described in [7].

"NETBLT (Network Block Transfer Protocol)", J. White, 04/16/1997. (61870 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The NETBLT protocol [RFC998] was designed as an experimental transport 
    layer protocol, intended for moving large quantities of data across a 
    wide variety of networks. It provides reliable bulk transfer with an 
    end-to-end flow-control mechanism meant to deal with network congestion
    by throttling the rate at which data is inserted into the network. 
    However, experiments with NETBLT across shared links revealed problems 
    with fairness; traffic from one connection could hog most of a link's 
    bandwidth, and there seems to be no way to prevent this under the 
    current rate-control scheme, so further application of NETBLT was not 
    pursued by its original developers.  However, NETBLT has a number of 
    characteristics which make it very attractive for use across noisy, 
    long-delay, slow-turnaround, or asymmetric communications links. Such 
    links are common in military usage, and may become more widespread with
    the development of mobile computing. NETBLT's attractive 
    characteristics include selective retransmission of lost packets, 
    potentially large transmission windows, and control of transmission 
    from the receiving, rather than the sending side; the latter makes

"Hierarchical HTTP Routing Protocol", Jeff Mogul, V. Valloppillil,   04/22/1997. (16310 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Recent interest in finding solutions for traffic problems stemming from
    HTTP have centered around the use of cooperating proxy-caches.         
    We contend that by using a deterministic, hash-based approach for 
    routing URLs within an 'array' of proxy servers, many of the benefits 
    of alternative cache cooperation protocols (such as ICP) may be 
    realized.     As an example of such an implementation we propose the 
    use of 'Proxy Client Configuration Files' between proxy servers in 
    order to exchange routing information.  This implementation is 
    motivated in part by the adoption of this file by existing, popular web
    browsers to provide intelligent URL request routing.                   
    This draft discusses adopting this well-understood, widely implemented 
    browser protocol by web proxies in order to facilitate intelligent 
    routing of requests within a network of proxy servers.

"IMAP4 Namespace", C Newman, M. Gahrns, 11/22/1997. (18350 bytes)</A>
<dd>     IMAP4[RFC-2060] does not define a default server namespace. As a
       result, two common namespace models have evolved:
     
       The ''Personal Mailbox'' model, in which the default namespace that 
    is
       presented consists of only the user's personal mailboxes. To access
       shared mailboxes, the user must use an escape mechanism to reach
       another namespace.
     
       The ''Complete Hierarchy'' model, in which the default namespace 
    that
       is presented includes the user's personal mailboxes along with any
       other mailboxes they have access to.
     
       These two models, create difficulties for certain client operations.
       This document defines a NAMESPACE command that allows a client to
       discover the prefixes of namespaces used by a server for personal
       mailboxes, other users' mailboxes, and shared mailboxes.  This

       routing decisions to these topology changes.  This document 
    describes
       a set of network protocols, which realize such a dynamical routing 
    of
       unicast and multicast packets within communication networks based on
       IPv6.  All used routing algorithms will be immediately executed at
       the occurrence of any topology changes and will therefore have
       already complete routing information at the receipt of data packets.
     
       For the unicasting the Shortest Path First (SPF) routing algorithm
       has be chosen.  This algorithm calculates the shortest, and 
    therefore
       the optimal routing paths within the routing area, by which it is
       sufficient for a router, to compute a single routing tree for the
       whole area.
     
       For the multicasting the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) routing
       algorithm has been chosen.  This distributed algorithm prevents the
       occurrence of endless routing loops, offers for distributed Address
       Groups nearly optimal results in saving network bandwidth, and needs
       also only a single routing tree for the whole area. This version 02

       packets on behalf of the virtual router.  End hosts forward their

"Application Protocol Design Principles", C Newman, 07/29/1997. (24629 bytes)</A>
<dd>          There are a number of design principles which come into play over
         and over again when designing application protocols.  Many of 
    these
         are entrenched in IETF lore and spread by word of mouth.  Most 
    have
         been learned the hard way many times.
     
         This is an attempt to codify some of these principles so they can
         be referenced rather than spread by word of mouth.  The author has
         not invented any of these ideas and while the exercise of finding
         the originator of the ideas would be interesting, it is not deemed
         necessary for this project.
     
         Many of these principles have a much wider scope than application
         protocol design.  However, the author's primary experience is with
         application protocols and examples provided usually involve
         application protocols or elements.

<dd>     This report contains a discussion of the difficult problem of key 
    management for multicast communication sessions.  It focuses on two 
    main areas of concern with respect to key management, which are, 
    initializing the multicast group with a common net key and rekeying the
    multicast group.  A rekey may be necessary upon the compromise of a

    This is one important feature of multicast key management which has not
    been addressed in detail by most other multicast key management 
    proposals [1,2,4].  The benefits of this proposed technique are that it

<dd>     Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] requires that when a BGP speaker receives an 
    OPEN message with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the 
    speaker must terminate BGP peering. This complicates introduction of 
    new capabilities in BGP.                                               
    This document defines new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities, that
    is expected to facilitate introduction of new capabilities in BGP by 
    providing graceful capability negotiation.                             
    The proposed parameter is backward compatible - a router that supports 
    the parameter can maintain BGP peering with a router that doesn't 
    support the parameter.

"LDAP Object Class for Application Users", B. Greenblatt, 07/21/1997. (3527 bytes)</A>
<dd>     In working with various directory enabled applications and services, it
    has been noticed that several of them presume the existence of an 
    auxiliary object class with no attributes that is used to detect 
    'their' users.  For example, the foo application service will use the 
    fooUser object class, and attach this object class to all of its user 
    objects in the directory in order that it may later on easily detect 
    'its' users, by virtue of the fact that those users are members of the 
    fooUser object class.  This fooUser object class is a subclass of top 
    with no additional attributes.  This specification intends to head off 
    the day when a user would get one of these applicationUser object class
    things attached to its directory object for each application that it 
    uses.  This would mean that that object's object class attribute would 
    eventually have dozens of values, which would in turn lessen the value 
    of this attribute.

    A low cost receiver can receive high bandwidth traffic from a feed, 
    while no bandwidth from the receiver to the feed is provided.  
    Therefore the connection between the feed and the receiver is 
    unidirectional. Current routing protocols stand on a fact that any

    different. They can not handle unidirectional links.

"IMSS: IP Multicast Shortcut Service", T. Anker, D. Breitgand, D. Dolev,   Z. Levy, 07/23/1997. (98233 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This memo describes an IP Multicast Shortcut Service (IMSS) over a 
    large ATM cloud. The service enables cut-through routing between 
    routers serving different Logical IP Subnets (LISs). The presented 
    solution is complementary to MARS [2], adopted as the IETF standard 
    solution for IP multicast over ATM.                                    
    IMSS consists of two orthogonal components: CONnection-oriented Group 
    address RESolution Service (CONGRESS) and IP multicast SErvice for 
    Non-broadcast Access Networking TEchnology (IP-SENATE). An IP class D 
    address is resolved into a set of addresses of multicast routers that 
    should receive the multicast traffic targeted to this class D address. 
    This task is accomplished using CONGRESS. The cut-through routing 
    decisions and actual data transmission are performed by IP-SENATE.     
    IMSS preserves the classical LIS model [8]. The scope of IMSS is to 
    facilitate inter-LIS cut-through routing, while MARS provides tools for
    the intra-LIS IP multicast.

"SOCKS V5 UDP and Multicast Extensions to Facilitate Multicast Firewall   Traversal", D. Chouinard, 11/18/1997. (55150 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This proposal creates a mechanism for managing the ingress or egress
       of IP multicast through a firewall.  It does this by defining
       extensions to the existing SOCKS V5 protocol [RFC-1928], which
       provides a framework for doing user-level, authenticated firewall
       traversal of unicast TCP and UDP traffic.  However, because the

       other deficiencies -- and these need to be addressed before
       multicast support can be achieved -- the extensions are defined in
       two parts: Base-level UDP extensions, and Multicast UDP extensions.

<dd>     This document addresses the end-to-end traffic management issues in
       IP/ATM internetworks. In the internetwork environment, the ATM
       control mechanisms (e.g., Available Bit Rate (ABR) and UBR with 
    Early
       Packet Discard (EPD)) are applicable to the ATM subnetwork, while 
    the
       TCP flow control extends from end to end. We investigated the end to
       end performance in terms of TCP throughput and file transfer delay 
    in
       cases using ABR and UBR in the ATM subnetwork. In this document, we
       also discuss the issue of trade-off between the buffer requirements
       at the ATM edge device (e.g., Ethernet-ATM switch, ATM router
       interface) versus ATM switches inside the ATM network.
     
       Our simulation results show that in certain scenarios (e.g., with
       limited edge device buffer memory) UBR with EPD may perform
       comparably to ABR or even outperform ABR. We show that it is not
       sufficient to have a lossless ATM subnetwork from the end-to-end
       performance point of view. The results illustrate the necessity for
       an edge device congestion handling mechanism that can couple the ABR
       and TCP feedback control loops.  We present an algorithm that makes
       use of the ABR feedback information and edge device congestion state
       to make packet dropping decisions at the edge of the ATM network.
       Using the algorithm at the edge device, the end-to-end performance 
    in
       throughput and delay are improved while using ABR as the ATM

"Error Record (ERR) for DNS", O. Gudmundsson, Robert Watson, 07/30/1997. (16905 bytes)</A>
<dd>     The DNS protocol defines a 4-bit RCODE field in the header of the DNS 
    envelope.  This field is used to indicate the completion status of 
    requests.  Defined values exist to describe successful completion as 
    well as a variety of error conditions that could result from DNS server
    operations.  As DNS has been expanded to perform additional functions,
    the number of possible error conditions has increased significantly, 
    and the field no longer has space for new error codes to be added.  To 
    address this problem, a new RR type is defined.  The Error Record 
    contains a machine-readable extended error value, as well as an 
    optional 
    human-readable ASCII text string.  Additionally, it contains a
    domain-name source field to identify the entity generating the error 
    condition.This RR may also be used in non-error conditions to provide

"When TCP Starts Up With Four Packets Into Only Three Buffers", C.   Partridge, Timothy Shepard, 08/01/1997. (10214 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Sally Floyd has proposed that TCPs start their initial slow start by
       sending as many as four packets (instead of the usual one packet) as
       a means of getting TCP up-to-speed faster.  (Slow starts instigated
       due to timeouts would still start with just one packet.)  Starting
       with more than one packet might reduce the start-up latency over
       long-fat pipes by two round-trip times.  This proposal is documented
       further in [1] and in [2] and we assume the reader is familiar with
       the details of this proposal.
     
       On the end2end-interest mailing list, concern was raised that in the
       (allegedly common) case where a slow modem is served by a router
       which only allocates three buffers per modem (one buffer being
        transmitted while two packets are waiting), that starting with four
       packets would not be good because the fourth packet is sure to be
       dropped.
     
       Vern Paxson replied with the comment (among other things) that the
       four-packet start is no worse than what happens after two round trip
       times in normal slow start, hence no new problem is introduced by
       starting with as many as four packets.   If there is a problem with 
    a
       four-packet start, then the problem already exists in a normal slow-
       start startup after two round trip times when the slow-start
       algorithm will release into the net four closely spaced packets.
     
       This memo is to document that in the case of a 9600 bps modem at the
       edges of a fast Internet where there are only 3 buffers before the
       modem (and the fourth packet of a four-packet start will surely be
       dropped), no significant degradation in performance is experienced
       with a four-packet start when compared with a normal slow start
       (which starts with one packet).

       identify issues in using ATM shortcuts for RSVP flows.  For purposes
       of illustrations, the NHRP protocol [LKPC97] will be assumed as
       the mechanism used to discover shortcuts, and a possible interface
       between RSVP and NHRP will be outlined.  However, it should be noted
       that other shortcut mechanisms are possible, e.g., PAR [J96], and
       the general conclusions of this document should also hold in such
       cases.  Since the issue of shortcut discovery is significantly more

"Short Port Commands for FTP", C. Metz, 09/02/1997. (9040 bytes)</A>
<dd>          RFC  1639[Pis94]  documents  experimental long port (LPRT) and 
    long
       passive (LPSV) commands that many IP Version  6  implementations  
    are
       using  as  the  replacement  for  the  PORT  and PASV commands in 
    FTP
       [PR85]. The author believes that this is the incorrect  direction  
    to
       be  heading  and  that the replacement for PORT and PASV should 
    carry
       less information instead of more.
    
        The short port command (SPORT) and short  passive  command  (SPASV)
       are  replacements  for  the PORT and PASV commands, respectively. 
    The
       short commands only carry port numbers and do  not  carry  
    addresses.
       This  makes them usable with IPv4 and IPv6. A benefit of not 
    carrying
       addresses is that pure network address translators (NAT) do not  
    have
       to  do  a search-and-replace on the TCP stream, which is an 
    expensive
       operation. This also precludes three-way FTP, which is a rarely  
    used
       mode  of operation that leaves most existing FTP servers wide open 
    to
    the FTP Bounce Attack [Hob95].
          
         The short port and passive commands  are  implemented  in  the  
    NRL
       IPv6+IPsec   software  distribution  and  the  descendant  
    inet6-apps distribution.

<dd>        P_Mul is a proposal for an application protocol for the transfer of

       nodes are able to receive messages, they are not able to acknowledge
       the receipt of messages.

       forwarding decisions at the routers by eliminating the need for

"Pulse-Per-Second API for UNIX", D. Mills, J Mogul, Jan Brittenson,   09/11/1997. (27036 bytes)</A>
<dd>     RFC1589 describes a UNIX kernel implementation model for
            high-precision time-keeping.  This is meant for use in

            or similar time synchronization protocols.  One aspect of
            this model is an accurate interface to the high-accuracy,
            one pulse-per-second (PPS) output typically available from
            precise time sources (such as a GPS or GOES receiver).
            RFC1589 did not define an API for managing the PPS

"Avoiding the TCP TIME_WAIT state at Busy Servers", J. Touch, Ted Faber,   Wei Yue, 09/11/1997. (34781 bytes)</A>
<dd>           This document describes the problems associated with the 
    accumulation
       of TCP TIME_WAIT states at a network server, such as a web server,
       and details two methods for avoiding that accumulation.  Servers 
    that
       have many TCP connections in TIME_WAIT state experience performance
       degradation, and can collapse.  One solution is a TCP modification
       that causes clients to enter TIME_WAIT state rather than servers.
       The other is an HTTP modification that allows the client to close 
    the
       transport connection, maintaining the TIME_WAIT state at the client.
       The goal of both approaches is ensure that TIME_WAIT states accumu-
       late at the less loaded endpoint.
    
       The document also presents initial performance data from reference
       implementations of these solutions, which suggest that the modifica-
       tions improve HTTP connection rates at the server by as much as 50%,
       and allow servers to operate at small transaction throughputs that
       they cannot sustain their default configuration.

"Extending POP Version 3 To Do Mailbox Compression", Harish Pillay,   Marvin Tay, 09/11/1997. (6432 bytes)</A>
<dd>             This document suggests an extension to the Post Office Protocol
            version 3 (RFC 1725) that adds an extra command to selective
            compress the maildrop before transferring the mail to the
            recipient.
     
            Given the extensive and explosive growth of mobile uses of the
            Internet especially the numbers of people who access their 
    e-mail
            via dialup modems, it does not make sense to have to transfer
            e-mail to the client in uncompressed form.

    server

            then for it to be sent to the client.  The client will then

"The SRP Authentication and Key Exchange System", Tom Wu, 09/11/1997. (15605 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes a cryptographically strong network
       authentication mechanism known as the Secure Remote Password (SRP)
       protocol.  This mechanism is suitable for negotiating secure
       connections using a user-supplied password, while eliminating the
       security problems traditionally associated with reusable passwords.
       This system also performs a secure key exchange in the process of
       authentication, allowing security layers (privacy and/or integrity
       protection) to be enabled during the session.  Trusted key servers
       and certificate infrastructures are not required, and clients are
       not required to store or manage any long-term keys.  SRP offers
       both security and deployment advantages over existing challenge-
       response techniques, making it an ideal drop-in replacement where
       secure password authentication is needed.

"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1", M. Crispin,   10/10/1997. (187228 bytes)</A>
<dd>         The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1)
       allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on
       a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote
       message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local
       folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline
       client to resynchronize with the server (see also [IMAP-DISC]).
    
       IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming
       mailboxes; checking for new messages; permanently removing messages;
       setting and clearing flags; [RFC-822] and [MIME-IMB] parsing;
       searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and
       portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of
       numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or 
    unique
       identifiers.
     
       IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing
       configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is
       discussed in [ACAP].
     
       IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is
       handled by a mail transfer protocol such as [SMTP].
     
       IMAP4rev1 is designed to be upwards compatible from the [IMAP2] and
       unpublished IMAP2bis protocols.  In the course of the evolution of
       IMAP4rev1, some aspects in the earlier protocol have become 
    obsolete.
       Obsolete commands, responses, and data formats which an IMAP4rev1
       implementation can encounter when used with an earlier 
    implementation
       are described in [IMAP-OBSOLETE].
    
       Other compatibility issues with IMAP2bis, the most common variant of
       the earlier protocol, are discussed in [IMAP-COMPAT].  A full
       discussion of compatibility issues with rare (and presumed extinct)
       variants of [IMAP2] is in [IMAP-HISTORICAL]; this document is

"HARP - ''Home Agent Redundancy Protocol''", Jim Binkley, Bjorn   Chambless, 10/30/1997. (39456 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document presents a protocol called the Home Agent Redundancy
       Protocol or HARP.  HARP is an optional extension to Mobile-IP [RFC-
       2002].  Mobile-IP includes the notion of a Home Agent which is
       a host located on the home IP subnet for Mobile Nodes.  Home Agents
       forward packets to Mobile Nodes that are away from home.  Since 
    Mobile
       Nodes are dependent on the Home Agent for connectivity when away 
    from
       home, the Home Agent represents a possible single source of failure 
    for
       the Mobile IP system.
     
       HARP is a protocol which allows a pair (or set) of Home Agents
       to cooperate and share Mobile-IP Mobile Node registration
       information.  If one of the HARP peers should fail, the Mobile-IP
       system will not necessarily fail, hence HARP introduces Home
       Agent redundancy into the Mobile-IP system.  Mobile Nodes are
       not aware that HARP exists, so HARP requires no changes to
       Mobile-IP as a protocol.  In this document, we present the HARP
       architecture and protocol.

"S/MIME Version 3 Message Specification", B. Ramsdell, 11/05/1997. (61731 bytes)</A>
<dd>     S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a
    consistent way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on the
    popular Internet MIME standard, S/MIME provides the following
    cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications:
    authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation of origin (using
    digital signatures) and privacy and data security (using encryption).
     
    S/MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add
    cryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to interpret
    cryptographic security services in mail that is received. However,
    S/MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any transport
    mechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP. As such, S/MIME
    takes advantage of the object-based features of MIME and allows secure
    messages to be exchanged in mixed-transport systems.
     
    Further, S/MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that
    use cryptographic security services that do not require any human
    intervention, such as the signing of software-generated documents and
    the encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.

"Simple Differential Services:  IP TOS and Precedence, Delay Indication,   and Drop Preference", P. Ferguson, 11/07/1997. (22945 bytes)</A>
<dd>         Recent opinions and sentiments expressed in the Internet
        Service Provider (ISP) community, as well as the Internet
        community at-large, have voiced concern over the applicability
        and scaleability of RSVP and the Integrated Service model in
        the global Internet infrastructure. Convincing arguments have
        been made for a differential services model which offers packet
        delivery services better than traditional best effort, yet not
        as resource intensive as RSVP. As a result, an effort within the
        Intergrated Services working group has been examining methods to
        provide simpler, less resource intensive methods of offering
        differentiated services. This draft provides a practical method
        to use bit values expressed in the IP Type or Service (TOS)
        and IP precedence fields for delay indication and packet drop
        preference, respectively.

"One Pass Multipart/Alternative Processing", L. Lundblade, 11/07/1997. (7491 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Most MIME syntax and semantics can usually be processed in a single
    pass through the data.  For example, the MIME boundary parameter always
    appears before it is used.  Similarly the security multiparts
    explicitly list the hash algorithm before the hashed (signed) data so
    the correct hash algorithm can be used to calculate the hash on the
    data as it is processed.
     
    This is not the case with multipart/alternative MIME structures.  The
    processor of the data cannot know the MIME types of the altnernatives
    present until all alternatives have been processed. Thus, it is not
    possible for a one pass processor to consider more than the first and
    most limited representation, because the second part or subsequent may
    be something that cannot be handled.
     
    A particular case of this occurs with alternative representations of
    types text/plain and text/html or text/enriched formats.  The
    text/plain representation must come first as required by the
    multipart/alternative standard.  If the processing is being done on a
    small device with limited memory it is most desirable to process the
    structure in one pass.  If the display is also small, for example 40
    colums rather than 80, it is desirable to use the text/html alternative
    because it appropriate to reflow HTML to fit the display.  Essentially,
    given some text that was composed with more than plain markup, (e.g.,
    HTML), it is preferrable to format the text with knowledge of the
    display, than use generically formatted text (i.e., the text/plain
    part).
     
    This memo proposes a parameter addition to the multipart/alternative
    MIME type that lists the MIME types of its alternative components.
    This allows a one-pass processor of the multipart/alternative entity to
    pick which alternative to use before processing the entire entity.

"Supporting IP Multicast Integrated Services in ATM Networks", M.   Smirnow, H. Sanneck, D. Witaszek, L. Salgarelli, A. Corghi, 11/10/1997. (54570 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This memo presents an integrated, server-based mechanism for the
       efficient support of the IP Integrated Services (IIS) model in ATM
       networks, namely the Multicast Integration Server (MIS) 
    architecture.
       Instead of viewing IP-ATM multicast address resolution and QoS
       support separately, the approach in this memo is to consider such
       issues in an integrated manner.  In particular, the MIS architecture
       defines how a layer-3 setup protocol as RSVP can be mapped to and
       integrated with a layer-2 multicast address resolution protocol as
       EARTH - EAsy Multicast Routing THrough ATM clouds.  With the use of
       EARTH, several ATM point-to-multipoint connections with different 
    QoS
       parameters can be associated to a single IP multicast address.  An
       RSVP server (RSVP-S) within the MIS is used to distribute RSVP
       messages inside the ATM cloud and to set the corresponding QoS state
       in the address resolution table of EARTH (setup protocol mapping).
       In addition, this memo defines a quantized heterogeneity model which
       supports, together with the MIS, advanced IIS features as QoS
       heterogeneity and dynamic QoS changes in IP-ATM networks.           (This Internet-Draft is also available in

"Japanese Character Encoding for Internet Messages",, 11/10/1997. (34190 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This memo describes the encoding used in electronic mail, NetNews,
        and world wide web messages in Japanese networks.  It was first
        specified by and used in JUNET then described in RFC 1468.  The 
    name
        of this encoding was originally known as ''JUNET code'' and is now
        called ''ISO-2022-JP'' when used in the context of MIME.
     
        In ISO-2022-JP text, both one 7-bit byte Latin script (ASCII or JIS
        X 0201 Latin set) and two 7-bit bytes Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana and
        some other symbols and characters (JIS X 0208) are employed.
        Switching the graphic character sets is based on the extension
        techniques defined in ISO 2022.
     
        This memo eliminates some ambiguities of RFC 1468.  However, it
        NEVER introduces any essential changes against RFC 1468.  Since the
        encoding is now widely used in Japanese IP communities, backward
        compatibility is most important in this revision.
     
        This memo revises RFC 1468 on the following points:
     
        1. It is clarified that ISO-2022-JP does NOT conform to ISO 2022.
        2. The formal syntax is divided into two new yet compatible rules,
            namely, ISO-2022-JP decoding syntax and ISO-2022-JP encoding
            syntax.
        3. The bit combinations permitted in JIS X 0208 are explicitly
            described in the syntax so that the invalid character positions
            will be excluded in ISO-2022-JP text.
        4. Recommended graphic character sets are specified.  That is, 
    ASCII
            is RECOMMENDED rather than JIS X 0201 1976 Latin set. ONLY to
            embed YEN SIGN and OVER LINE, JIS 0201 Latin set MAY be used.
            Also, JIS X 0208 1983 (including 1990) is RECOMMENDED rather
            than JIS X 0208 1978.

       [12] [21].
     
       PDIs are intended primarily as permanent identifiers for archival
       reference to long-lived documents.  PDIs have a fragment syntax to
       allow permanent references to parts of documents (within specific
       formats) as well as a citation syntax to allow references to
       appearances of such fragments in composite documents.
     
       PDIs are most useful for any document series that is distributed via

"IMAP4 Child Mailbox Extension", M. Gahrns, 11/14/1997. (8171 bytes)</A>
<dd>        Many IMAP4 [RFC-2060] clients present to the user a hierarchical
       view of the mailboxes that a user has access to.  Rather than
       initially presenting to the user the entire mailbox hierarchy, it is
       often preferable to show to the user a collapsed outline list of the
       mailbox hierarchy (particularly if there is a large number of
       mailboxes).  The user can then expand the collapsed outline
       hierarchy as needed.  It is common to include within the collapsed
       hierarchy a visual clue (such as a ''+'') to indicate that there are
       child mailboxes under a particular mailbox.   When the visual clue
       is clicked the hierarchy list is expanded to show the child
       mailboxes.
     
       The CHILDREN extension provides a mechanism for a client to
       efficiently determine if a particular mailbox has children, without
       issuing a LIST '' * or a LIST '' % for each mailbox name.

"A Proposal to add Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IPv6 and to   TCP", K. Ramakrishnan, S. Floyd, 11/17/1997. (27414 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This note describes a proposed addition of ECN (Explicit Congestion
       Notification) to IPv6 and to TCP.  First we describe TCP's use of
       packet drops as an indication of congestion.  Next we argue that 
    with
       the addition of active queue management (e.g., RED) to the Internet
       infrastructure, where routers detect congestion before the queue
       overflows, routers are no longer limited to packet drops as an
       indication of congestion, but could instead set an ECN bit in the
       packet header, for ECN-capable transport protocols.  We describe 
    when
       the ECN bit would be set in the routers, and describe what
       modifications would be needed to TCP to make it ECN-capable.
       Modifications to other transport protocols (e.g., unreliable unicast
       or multicast, reliable multicast, other reliable unicast transport
       protocols) could be considered as those protocols advance through 
    the
       standards process.

"Handle System: A Persistent Global Naming Service Overview and Syntax",   Sam Sun, 11/18/1997. (27316 bytes)</A>
<dd>        The Handle System (r) is a comprehensive system  for assigning,
       managing, and resolving persistent identifiers, known as
       ''handles,'' for digital objects and other resources on the 
    Internet.
       Handles can be used as Uniform Resource Names (URNs). The Handle
       System includes:(a) an open set of protocols, (b) a namespace,
       and (c) an implementation of the protocols. The protocols enable
       a distributed computer system to store handles of digital
       resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary
       to locate and access the resources. This associated information
       can be changed as needed to reflect the current state of the
       identified resource without changing the handle, thus allowing the
       name of the item to persist over changes of location and other
       state information. Combined with a centrally administered naming
       authority registration service, the Handle System provides a
       general purpose, distributed global naming service for the reliable
       management of information on networks over long periods of time.
       (Note that in this document we do not attempt to distinguish
       between the terms 'name' and 'indentifier' and will use them
       interchangably.)
     
       The Handle System has been implemented and is currently in use in
       a number of prototype projects, including efforts with the Library
       of Congress, the Association of American Publishers, the Defense 
          Technical Information Center, and the United States Information
       Agency.
     
       This is the first of a series of planned documents that will
       specify the handle protocol and services, and relate the Handle
       System to other IETF activities in URN/URI/URL working groups.

"The UDP Multicast Tunneling Protocol", Ross Finlayson, 11/19/1997. (13189 bytes)</A>
<dd>     Many Internet hosts - such as PCs - while capable of running multicast

    establish an 'ad hoc' connection to the MBone by tunneling multicast 
    UDP
    datagrams inside unicast UDP datagrams.  By using UDP, this tunneling 
    can
    be implemented as a 'user level' application, without requiring changes

"The uuid: URI scheme", C. Kindel, 11/20/1997. (9958 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This memo describes a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) scheme that
    allows resources to be uniquely named over time and space using
    Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). A UUID URI is a pure URI, in
    that it contains no information about location. However due to the
    uniqueness of UUIDs, a UUID URI is persistent over time, much like
    URNs. UUID URIs are useful in situations where a unique identifier is
    required that cannot or should not be tied to a particular physical
    root namespace (such as a DNS name).

"IPv6 traceroute option", A. Durand, 11/21/1997. (12612 bytes)</A>
<dd>         The traceroute program has proven very useful and has been
        extensively used in the Internet for measurement and debugging
        purposes. However, it only shows the originator to target path
        and gives no indication on the reverse path. Source routing may
        sometimes be used to find it, but it's very often disable by
        intermediary routers.
        Another problem occurs when packets do not follow the same routes:
        traceroute outputs are very difficult to read.
     
        Other solutions has been proposed to record the route taken by
        an IPv4 packet. Originally, IPv4 contains an option in which every
        intermediary router can add its address [RFC791]. Unfortunately,
        the limitation in size imposed by the options design of IPv4 limits
        its use to 9 routers.
     
        In [RFC1393] another strategy was proposed. An new IPv4 option was
        created. When a router receives a packet containing this option,
        it generates a ICMP Echo message to the source. This technique
        couldn't be widely deployed in IPv4 because it needed a change
        in every single router to be efficient.
     
        These two methods create less traffic on the network and are more
        accurate, since they give the real route taken by packets and are
        less sensitive to fluttering. The IPv6 deployment could be the
        opportunity to widely deploy a new traceroute mechanism based on
        those two methods.
     
        We propose to combine the two previous methods by defining a new
        hop-by-hop option and a new ICMP message type to record the direct
        path from the originator to the target and the reverse path from
        the target to the originator.

"Proxy PAR", T. Przygienda, Patrick Droz, 11/21/1997. (22613 bytes)</A>
<dd>        Proxy PAR is a minimal version of PAR (PNNI Augmented Routing) that
       gives ATM attached devices the ability to interact with PNNI devices
       without the necessity to fully support PAR. Proxy PAR is designed as
       a client/server interaction where the client side is much simpler
       than the server side to allow for fast implementation and 
    deployment.
     
       The purpose of Proxy PAR is to allow non-ATM devices to use the
       flooding mechanisms provided by PNNI for registration and automatic
       discovery of services registered in the network.  The mechanisms
       are protocol independent but in first version support for IPv4
       services mainly has been specified.  In addition, Proxy PAR server
       capable nodes provide filtering based on IP protocols and address
       prefixes.  This makes, e.g.  possible for router running OSPF to 
    find
       OSPF neighbors on the same subnet.  The protocol is built using a
       registration/query approach where devices can register their 
    services
       and query for services and protocols registered by other clients.

<dd>               A  new  kind of application is emerging on the Internet, 
    driven
              by the desire of individuals to know instantly whether 
    another
              individual is online,  to be notified when another individual
              arrives online, and to send messages in `real time'.  These 
    are
              all special cases of the more general problem of 
    Internet-wide
              notification.
     
              This protocol for facilitating rendezvous between users, 
    known
              herein as the Rendez-Vous Protocol (RVP), is  designed  to 
    enable
              such notifications and messages across a loosely coupled
              (federated) constellation of servers.  RVP is designed to 
    address
              the need for notification in a secure, reliable and scaleable
              fashion.  RVP encompasses the client-server and server-server
              interactions.
     
              The authors recognize that there is significant overlap with
              between RVP and HTTP, though there are also significant
              differences.  We expect this draft to evolve and either 
    converge
              or diverge with HTTP and/or other existing protocols.  The

"Aggregating RSVP-based QoS Requests", R. Guerin, Shai Herzog, S. Blake,   11/26/1997. (54517 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This document describes issues and approaches related to aggregation
       of QoS requests, when RSVP [BZB+97] is the protocol used to convey
       such requests.  Aggregation is an important component to provide
       scalable QoS solutions, especially in the core of the backbone
       where the sheer number of flows mandates some form of aggregation.
       However, aggregation needs to be provided without impacting the
       ability to provide end-to-end QoS guarantees to individual flows.
       In this document, we review some of the main goals of aggregation
       and describe possible solutions, that do not preclude support for
       end-to-end QoS guarantees.  Those solutions are targeted at unicast
       flows as we expect them to represent a large fraction of the flows
       requesting reservation, and hence to be the main contributors to
       potential scalability problems with RSVP.                           (This Internet-Draft is also available in

"THE TRANSMISSION OF IP OVER THE VERTICAL BLANKING INTERVAL OF A PAL   TELEVISION SIGNAL", Nick Thorne, 11/26/1997. (32903 bytes)</A>
<dd>     This is an Internet-Draft, which describes a method for broadcasting
    multicast IP data using the vertical blanking interval of a PAL

    multicast IP headers on unidirectional networks, a framing protocol
    identical to SLIP,  forward error correction schemes for the WST
    standards. A related Internet-Draft, Ref.[1], is progressing
    transmission of IP over the VBI of an NTSC television signal.

"Pre-Shared Key Extensions for ISAKMP/Oakley", Shawn Mamros, 11/26/1997. (10740 bytes)</A>
<dd>               The application of IP Security for remote access over the

"Coexistence and Interoperability of NTP Authentication Schemes", D.   Mills, 11/26/1997. (21087 bytes)</A>
<dd>        This memorandum describes extensions to the Network Time Protocol
       (NTP) version 3, described in RFC 1305 [MIL92], and the Simple
       Network Time Protocol (SNTP) version 4, described in RFC 2030
       [MIL96a], to create a framework for interoperability and coexistence
       of various cryptographic signature and authentication schemes that
       have been suggested as enhancements to NTP/SNTP [MIL96b]. Without
       describing any particular approach to authentication in detail, a
       framework is hereby established for these schemes and methods to
       coexist and interoperate on a single network or Internet.
     
       NTP v3, as specified in RFC 1305, provides support for a method
       of symmetric-key authentication. This model requires independent,
       out-of-band, distribution of cryptographic keys, with the associated
       risk of compromising those keys during distribution. This process is
       too costly and too great a security risk for universal application.
     
       The NTP protocol extensions described here allow for the creation
       of certified time from a certified and authenticated time source,
       for use in portable commercial-grade trust, non-repudiated logging,
       cryptographic synchronization, and other critical network management
       services. Newer cryptographic techniques involving public-key
       certificates and authentication (see the series of Internet-Drafts
       by the Public Key Infrastructure X.509 [PKIX] working groups of
       the IETF) can elevate timestamping to a trustable resource.
