    <dd>The IETF working groups such as Integrated Services
        (called ''int-serv'') and RSVP [1] have developed
        extensions to the IP architecture and the best-effort
        service model so that applications or end users can
        request specific quality (or levels) of service from an
        internetwork in addition to the current IP best-effort
        service. The int-serv model for these new services
        requires explicit signaling of the QoS (Quality of
        Service) requirements from the end points and provision
        of admission and traffic control at Integrated Services
        routers. The proposed standards for RSVP [RFC 2205] and
        Integrated Services [RFC 2211, RFC 2212] are examples of
        a new reservation setup protocol and new service
        definitions respectively. Under the int-serv model,
        certain data flows receive preferential treat- ment over
        other flows; the admission control component only takes
        into account the requester's resource reservation request
        and available capa- city to determine whether or not to
        accept a QoS request. However, the int-serv mechanisms do
        not include an important aspect of admission con- trol:
        network managers and service providers must be able to
        monitor, con- trol, and enforce use of network resources
        and services based on policies derived from criteria such
        as the identity of users and applications,
        traffic/bandwidth requirements, security considerations,
        and time-of- day/week. </dd>
