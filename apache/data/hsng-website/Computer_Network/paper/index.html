                This project is to create an asynchronous learning environment which provides students and instructors with flexible learning and teaching activities. Generally speaking, the purposes of this project are to: 1. design and develop an asynchronous learning
                environment; 2. investigate the advantages and limitations of this learning system. Forty-two junior and senior undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science participated in this project. A questionnaire survey was administered at
                the end of this semester to analyze the pros and cons of the project. The results indicate that students appreciate the flexibility and user-friendliness of the tools created for this learning environment. However, only 55% of students
                showed positive attitudes toward interaction, which was considered one of the main goals of the project. This finding reveals that much effort needs to be made in creating tools with stronger interaction functions.
