<p>
 The pervasion of technology provides a wide range of the possibilities
for learning.  In addition to the regular classroom setting, there
are many other ways for learners to learn.  This project is to
create an asynchronous learning environment which provides students
and instructors the flexibility in learning and teaching activities.
 Generally speaking, the purposes of this project are to: 1. design
and develop the asynchronous learning environment; 2. investigate
the advantages and limitations of this learning system.
<P>
 Subjects consisted of 42 junior and senior undergraduate students.
 One instructor and three teaching assistants are responsible
for this project, including creating necessary tools for this
learning environment, a three-hour classroom teaching and some
off-line assistance.
<P>
 Results indicated that, first of all, this learning system could
be used to catch up learning for those who fell behind in the
regular classroom learning.  Second, some tools created in this
project, such as the chat room, bulletin board, e-mail, etc. did
facilitate the interaction between students and instructors.
Third, teachers and students got feedback much sooner compared
with the traditional classroom teaching.
</P>

<P>
<B>1.  Introduction</B>
<P>
<B> </B>Educators have always been attracted to issues involved
with students' learning achievement and treatment.  Since technology
rapidly advances in teaching and learning activities, the problems
of individual differences can be taken care of more effectively.
Owing to computer network technology, individualized instruction
becomes more pervasive.  However, because of environmental and
cost considerations, some teaching has to be carried out in the
mass instruction format. In this case, designing a flexible learning
environment is very desirable because it can allow students to
catch up on learning they have missed in the classroom and because
student achievement will be enhanced via the utilization of computer-based
technologies (CBL) (Oliver, R.G. 1997).
<P>
  Research has reported that an asynchronous learning environment
has great impact on student learning.  In this learning environment,
it has been found that peer interaction increases compared to
a traditional learning environment (Ahern, 1992).  Factors that
affect the creation of an asynchronous learning environment were
examined in several research studies (Sener, 1996; Terrell, 1996;
Sugar, et al. 1995; Newbold, 1993).  These studies found that
in creating an asynchronous learning environment, one must consider
the following elements: access to large amounts of information,
developing effective teaching and learning activities to suit
individual needs, transmitting contents via multiple forms of
media, high levels of learner control, etc.  Several studies indicated
that lower costs and increasing capabilities of hardware and communications
technology would lead directly to the development and use of audio,
graphics, and full-motion video programs for distant learners
in this learning environment.
<P>
  This paper will describe the current project at National Chung
Cheng University in Taiwan in the design and development of an
asynchronous learning environment.  This project involves the
use of computer-based learning in the design and development process
of interactive multimedia as a means to bring about enhanced learning
outcomes among 42 junior and senior undergraduate students in
the <a href="http://exodus.cs.ccu.edu.tw"> 
&quot;Computer Networks&quot; </a> course.  Course content is delivered
via text, graphics, animation, and real audio. Aside from the
weekly three-hour classroom period, students enrolled in this
course access the learning materials at their convenience.  The
following section explains the details of this project.  <BR>
<P>
<B>2.  Development of an Asynchronous Learning Environment</B>
<P>
 Generally speaking, an asynchronous learning environment provides
students with teaching materials and tools for registration, instruction,
and discussion.  The ultimate goal of this project is to offer
interactive resources available at the learner's convenience.
 Several tools have been developed by this project to make asynchronous
learning more effective and user-friendly.  They are schematically
described in Figure 1.<BR>

<P>
<B>Tools for an asynchronous learning environment</B>
<P>
  It is well recognized that computer-based technologies provide
not only the means for effective instructional strategies, but
also intelligent and convenient management.  In the part of project
we are working now, both instructional and managerial tools are
being developed to support teaching and learning.  On the World
Wide Web (WWW) homepage of this project, different icons with
hyperlinks direct readers to the tools they need.<BR>
<P>
<B>Registration Tool</B>
<P>
This tool is designed to ease class management. Students are required
to use this tool to add or withdraw from the course and to provide
personal information, such as their student id, email address,
and personal homepage address.  In addition, instructors can make
on-line inquiries about the most recent name list for the class,
send email to a student by simply clicking the name of the student,
or link to the student's homepage via hyperlink.<BR>
<P>
<B>Announcement Tool</B>
<P>
Instructors can post news or announcements via this tool.  Such
things as names of absent students, student involvement in the
asynchronous learning environment, changes in class hours, etc.
are posted here and students can access the posted information
at any time. In Taiwan, due to the traditional culture, college
students still need intensive supervision, such as enforced class
attendance, in order to improve their learning achievement. Therefore,
class attendance and participation in the asynchronous learning
environment are part of their performance evaluation and are posted.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Lecture Notes</B>
<P>
Instead of putting the slides of lecture notes on the Web, all
lecture contents and supplemental materials are carefully designed
by the use of multiple forms of media such as text, graphics,
animation, and real-time audio. Students are able to get detailed
information not covered in class due to the limited lecture time.
The use of animation helps the student understand network protocols
by demonstrating how protocols operate in real networks. For example,
the operation of CSMA/CD protocol, which is the medium access
control protocol of Ethernet, is animated to show why collisions
happen, how long to detect a collision, how to select a random
time to wait according to the exponential backoff algorithm. Some
students, especially foreign students, may have difficulty understanding
the materials delivered in class due to language problems. Therefore,
the voice of the instructor is recorded during each lecture and
stored in the real audio server.  Students can listen to the audio
via the real-time audio player as they browse the lecture contents.
The real-time audio tools we use were developed by Progressive
Networks.<BR>
<P>
<B>Discussion Tool</B>
<P>
We believe that the interaction and communication between students
and instructors and among students themselves play an important
role in the learning process. Therefore, several discussion tools
are provided to allow students to interact with instructors as
well as among themselves. 
<UL>
<LI><B>BBS </B>
</UL>
<P>
BBS is one of the most popular network tools in Universities in
Taiwan. Many students spend several hours per day on BBS to read
posted news and talk to friends. We have observed that most Taiwanese
students would rather ask questions on BBS than in class. Therefore,
we provide a network-course board on our BBS on which students
can post anything related to this course. Instructors monitor
the board and answer questions posed by students. In fact, we
find that BBS provides a very effective environment for students
to be able to interact and communicate among themselves because
some students try to provide answers (thoughts) before the instructors
do.  Some of these thoughts are so creative and fruitful that
even the instructors would not have thought of them.  This phenomenon
may be due to two factors: first, the students feel more comfortable
expressing their opinions on BBS than in class or face-to-face
discussion; second, traditional Chinese culture makes the students
quite nervous in class.<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>News</B>
</UL>
<P>
One of the disadvantages of BBS is lack of multimedia support,
which limits the ways in which students express their thoughts.
Since Netscape News supports MIME format, we have also provided
a local news group to which students may post their questions.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Chat room</B>
</UL>
<P>
Many researchers have reported that tutoring also plays an important
role in the learning process. Therefore, we have developed a WWW-based
chat room (using JAVA) which can be used for interactions and
communications among instructors and multiple students.  As with
office hours, instructors announce when they will enter the chat
room. Students who have questions can then enter the chat room
during that time. Unlike BBS and News, chat room provides synchronous
tutoring which seems to be a more effective learning tool for
some students. Since some students have difficulty typing Chinese
characters, we are planning to add an audio-based chat room using
such programs as Internet Phone and Netscape Cool Talk.<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>FAQ</B>
</UL>
<P>
Some questions posted on BBS, News, and chat room are so frequently
asked that we feel a FAQ tool is necessary to avoid repetitive
answers. Instructors can summarize frequently asked questions
and their answers and post the FAQ on the WWW via this tool.<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>E-Mail</B>
</UL>
<P>
The E-Mail tool is provided to allow students and instructors
to send mail. Students or instructors may want to send mail to
a group of people, e.g., students may want to send mail to instructors
(including tutors) to ask questions, or instructors may want to
send mail to teaching assistants or all students. By using CGI
and form, the E-Mail tool makes sending mail to a predefined group
much easier.<BR>
<P>
<B>Homework Assignments</B>
<P>
All homework and programming assignments are posted here. The
written homework is posted first. A FAQ is then posted which contains
answers to all of the questions related to the homework posted
on BBS, News, and chat room. After the homework is due, the suggested
answers are posted. For programming assignments, a similar process
is conducted except that source codes for demonstration are also
posted. Students can turn in their written homework in class or
use the turnin software available in UNIX. However, students are
required to turn in their programs using the turnin software.
<BR>
<P>
<B>3.  Evaluation</B> 
<P>
  Student achievement is evaluated by paper-and-pencil tests and
an on-line quiz. In addition, the project itself will be evaluated
via formative and summative evaluation.  Formative evaluation
is an on-going process and most student opinions will be taken
as meaningful feedforward to revise the project from time to time,
so that the project can better suit the needs of different students.
 A questionnaire survey, to serve as the basis of a summative
evaluation, was administered at the end of this semester to collect
data to analyze the advantages and limitations of the project.
Of 42 students participating in the project, 36 (about 86%) answered
the questionnaire.  The results can be summarized as follows:
<OL>
<LI>First, we wanted to know how many students used the tools
created for this project, and we found that the registration and
assignment tools were used by every student who answered the questionnaire;
the lecture notes, BBS, and E-Mail were used by most students,
the average percentage reaching 90.  However, few students used
the news and FAQ, the average percentage reaching only 50.
<LI>Among the tools created for this learning environment, we
wanted to know which were considered by the students to provide
the greatest assistance in learning.  The results indicated that
most students (34 of 36) thought the lecture notes were very helpful,
and very few (3 of 36) thought the news to be useful in learning.
<LI>The results also revealed students' perceptions of the advantages
of this learning environment.  More than 85% thought the time
flexibility was the greatest advantage, and 75% thought the user-friendliness
was another advantage.  However, as for the interactive functions,
only 55% indicated a positive opinion.
</OL>
<P>
<B>4. Conclusion</B>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the results stated above, we may conclude that, first,
most students do appreciate the flexibility and user-friendliness
of the tools created for this learning environment.  Second, the
results showing that most of the students used the lecture notes,
BBS, and E-Mail instead of the news and FAQ reveal that some tools
may possess very similar functions and students may simply use
the one they are most familiar with.  Thus, we might consider
eliminating some tools and spending more time on strengthening
their function.
<LI>Interaction is considered one of the main goals in this project,
but the results report that only 55% of students showed positive
attitudes toward it; the results also indicate that there is still
much room for us to improve the functions of interaction when
designing tools for this learning environment.   
</OL>
<P>
 
<P>
<B>5.  Recommendation for Further Studies</B>
<P>
 Instructional and computer-based technologies contribute a great
deal to the creation of student-centered learning environments,
and as university teaching staff, we are obliged to push toward
more open and varied instructional delivery modes (Oliver, 1997).
 Further studies are suggested to group students based on gender,
entry behavior, grades and prerequisites, etc. in order to compare
their learning achievement as well as learning attitudes as basic
data necessary to an understanding of the advantages provided
by different learning environments for different levels of students.
