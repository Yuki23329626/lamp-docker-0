        <p>
            The pervasion of technology provides a wide range of the possibilities for learning. In addition to the regular classroom setting, there are many other ways for learners to learn. This project is to create an asynchronous learning environment which provides
            students and instructors the flexibility in learning and teaching activities. Generally speaking, the purposes of this project are to: 1. design and develop the asynchronous learning environment; 2. investigate the advantages and limitations
            of this learning system.
            <P>
                Subjects consisted of 42 junior and senior undergraduate students. One instructor and three teaching assistants are responsible for this project, including creating necessary tools for this learning environment, a three-hour classroom teaching and some
                off-line assistance.
                <P>
                    Results indicated that, first of all, this learning system could be used to catch up learning for those who fell behind in the regular classroom learning. Second, some tools created in this project, such as the chat room, bulletin board, e-mail, etc.
                    did facilitate the interaction between students and instructors. Third, teachers and students got feedback much sooner compared with the traditional classroom teaching.

                    <B>1.  Introduction</B>
                    <P>
                        <B> </B>Educators have always been attracted to issues that involved with students' learning achievement and treatment. Since technology rapidly advances in teaching and learning activities, the problems of individual differences can be
                        taken care of more effectively. Owing to the computer network technology, the individualized instruction becomes more pervasive. However, because of some environmental and cost considerations, some of the teaching has to be carried
                        out in the mass instruction format. In this case, designing the flexible learning environment is very desirable because for one reason, it can allow students to catch up some learning which they have missed in the classroom, and
                        on the other hand, students' achievement will be enhanced via the utilization of computer-based technologies (CBL) (Oliver, R.G. 1997).
                        <P>
                            Research has reported that the asynchronous learning environment has great impact on students' learning. In this learning environment, it was investigated that the peer interaction was increased compared with in the traditional learning environment (Ahern,
                            1992). Factors that affect the creation of the asynchronous learning environment were examined in several research studies (Sener, 1996; Terrell, 1996; Sugar, et al. 1995; Newbold, 1993). It has been recognized that to create
                            the asynchronous learning environment must consider the following elements: the access to large information, developing effective teaching and learning activities to suit individual needs, transmitting contents via multiplicity
                            forms of media, the high levels of learner control, etc. Several studies indicated that lower costs and increasing capabilities of hardware and communications technology would lead directly to the development and use of audio,
                            graphics, and full-motion video programs for distant learners in this learning environment.
                            <P>
                                This paper will describe the current project at National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan into the design and development of the asynchronous learning environment. This project involves the use of computer-based learning in the design and development
                                process of interactive multimedia as a means to bring about enhanced learning outcomes among 42 junior and senior undergraduate students in the course of &quot;
                                <A HREF="http://exodus.cs.ccu.edu.tw"> Computer Networks </A> &quot;. Learning contents were delivered via the forms of text, graphics, animation, and real audio. Aside from the three-hour classroom learning, students enrolled in this course can get access to the learning materials
                                at their conveniences. The following section will explain the details of this project.

                                    <P>
                                        Generally speaking, the asynchronous learning environment provides students the teaching materials and some tools for registration, instruction, and discussion. The ultimate goal of this project was to offer interactive resources available at the learner's
                                        convenience. Several tools were developed in this project to make the asynchronous learning more effective and user-friendly. They are schematically described in Figure 1.

                                                    It is well recognized that computer-based technologies provides not only the means for effective instructional strategies, but also intelligent and convenient management. In the project that we are working now, both instructional and managerial tools
                                                    were developed to support teaching and learning. In the World Wide Web (WWW) homepage of this project, different icons with hyperlinks are shown to direct readers to tools that they are interested.

Students are required to add or withdraw this course and provide personal information, such as student id, email address, and personal homepage address, via this tool. On the other hand, instructors
                                                            could make on-line inquiries about the most updated name list of this class, send email to a student by simply clicking the name of the student, or link to the student's homepage via hyperlink.

                                                                        <P>

Students are able
                                                                            to get more detailed information that are not covered in the class due to the limited lecture time. The use of animation helps the student understand some network protocols by
                                                                            viewing how protocols operate in real networks. Foe example, the operation of CSMA/CD protocol, which is the medium access control protocol of Ethernets, is animated to show why
                                                                            collisions happen, how long to detect a collision, how to select a random time to wait according to the exponential backoff algorithm. Some students, such as foreign students,
                                                                            may have difficult time on understanding the materials delivered in class due to language problem. Therefore, the voice of the instructor was recorded during each lecture time
                                                                            and stored in the real audio server. The students can listen to the audio via real-time audio player as they browse the lecture contents. The real-time audio tools we used are
                                                                            developed by Progressive Networks.

Therefore, several discussion tools are provided for students to be able to interact with
                                                                                    instructors as well as among themselves.

                                                                                        BBS is one of the most popular network tools in Universities in Taiwan. Many students spend several hours on BBS to read posted news and talk to friends. We have observed that most Taiwanese students rather asking questions on BBS than in the class. Therefore,
                                                                                        we provide a network-course board on our BBS in which students can post anything related to this course. Instructors will monitor the board and answer questions that
                                                                                        posed by students. In fact, we find that BBS provides a very effective environment for students to be able to interact and communicate among themselves because some
                                                                                        students will try to provide their answers (thoughts) before the instructors get the time to answer the questions. Some of the thoughts are so creative and fruitful
                                                                                        that even the instructors cannot think of. This phenomena may due to the two factors: first, the students feel more comfortable to express their opinions on BBS than
                                                                                        in class or face-to-face discussion; second, the traditional Chinese culture makes the students quite nervous in class.

Therefore, it limits the way that students express their thoughts. Since the news tool of Netscape supports MIME format, we have also provided a local news group for students to post their

Therefore, we have developed a WWW-based chat room (using JAVA) which can be used for interactions and communications among instructors and more than one students.
                                                                                                Similar to office hours, the instructors will announce when they will enter the chat room. Students who have questions can then enter the chat room during
