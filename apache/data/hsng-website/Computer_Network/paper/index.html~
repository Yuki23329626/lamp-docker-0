<p>
 The pervasion of technology provides a wide range of the possibilities
for learning.  In addition to the regular classroom setting, there
are many other ways for learners to learn.  This project is to
create an asynchronous learning environment which provides students
and instructors the flexibility in learning and teaching activities.
 Generally speaking, the purposes of this project are to: 1. design
and develop the asynchronous learning environment; 2. investigate
the advantages and limitations of this learning system. 
<P>
 Subjects consisted of 42 junior and senior undergraduate students.
 One instructor and three teaching assistants are responsible
for this project, including creating necessary tools for this
learning environment, a three-hour classroom teaching and some
off-line assistance.
<P>
 Results indicated that, first of all, this learning system could
be used to catch up learning for those who fell behind in the
regular classroom learning.  Second, some tools created in this
project, such as the chat room, bulletin board, e-mail, etc. did
facilitate the interaction between students and instructors. 
Third, teachers and students got feedback much sooner compared
with the traditional classroom teaching.
